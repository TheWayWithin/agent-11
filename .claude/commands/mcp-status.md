# MCP Status Checker

**Usage:** `/mcp-status`

Shows which MCP profile is currently active and what tools are connected.

---

## Your Task

The user wants to see their current MCP profile status.

**Step 1: Check active profile**

Run this command:
```bash
ls -l .mcp.json
```

This shows which profile is active (the symlink target).

**Step 2: Parse the result**

Extract the profile name from the output. For example:
- `.mcp.json -> .mcp-profiles/testing.json` means **testing** profile is active
- `.mcp.json -> .mcp-profiles/core.json` means **core** profile is active

**Step 3: Report status**

Tell the user in this format:
```
üìä MCP Profile Status

Current Profile: [profile-name]

Included MCPs:
‚Ä¢ [list each MCP server that's in this profile]

Context Usage: [X tokens] ([Y%] reduction from fullstack)

Best for: [what this profile is optimized for]

To switch profiles: /mcp-switch [profile-name]
To see all profiles: /mcp-list
```

**Step 4: Verify MCPs are actually connected**

After reporting, you can optionally verify by checking available tools:
- Look for tools starting with `mcp__` prefix
- Confirm they match the expected profile

If there's a mismatch, warn the user:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Profile mismatch detected!

Expected MCPs: [list]
Actually connected: [list]

This usually means you need to restart Claude Code:
1. Type: /exit
2. Then run: claude
```

## Error Handling

**If .mcp.json doesn't exist:**
```
‚ùå MCP profile not configured

It looks like you haven't set up MCP profiles yet.

To get started:
1. Run: /mcp-switch core
2. Restart Claude Code: /exit then claude

This will set up the recommended core profile.
```

**If .mcp.json is a regular file (not a symlink):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration issue detected

Your .mcp.json is not a symlink to a profile. This might be from an old setup.

To fix:
1. Backup current config: cp .mcp.json .mcp.json.backup
2. Switch to a profile: /mcp-switch core
3. Restart: /exit then claude

## Communication Style

‚úÖ **Use clear, visual formatting**
‚úÖ **Include emojis for quick scanning**
‚úÖ **Show next actions clearly**
‚úÖ **Warn about important things (production access, read-only mode)**

‚ùå Don't be verbose
‚ùå Don't use technical jargon
‚ùå Don't hide important warnings
