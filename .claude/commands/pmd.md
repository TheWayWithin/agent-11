# POST MORTEM DUMP (PMD) ANALYSIS üîç

**Command**: `/pmd [issue_description]`

**Arguments**: 
- `issue_description` (optional): Specific issue to analyze. If not provided, analyzes recent failures from progress.md

## PMD ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

You are conducting a systematic post-mortem analysis to identify root causes in agent performance, documentation, and system configuration.

### EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Issue Identification**
   - If issue_description provided, focus on that specific problem
   - Otherwise, analyze recent issues from progress.md
   - Check for patterns in repeated failures

2. **Root Cause Analysis**

Examine these areas systematically:

#### A. Agent Performance Analysis
```
- Agent Prompts: Are instructions clear and complete?
- Scope Boundaries: Are agents staying in their lanes?
- Coordination: Is Task tool being used correctly?
- Handoffs: Are deliverables clearly defined?
```

#### B. Documentation Quality
```
- CLAUDE.md: Is it current and comprehensive?
- project-plan.md: Are tasks well-defined?
- progress.md: Are issues being logged properly?
- Ideation docs: Do they provide sufficient context?
```

#### C. Tool Usage Patterns
```
- MCP Usage: Are agents checking for MCPs first?
- Task Tool: Is delegation working correctly?
- File Operations: Are paths and edits correct?
- Error Handling: Are failures being caught?
```

#### D. Process Issues
```
- Planning: Was the approach correct?
- Communication: Were requirements clear?
- Testing: Were edge cases considered?
- Monitoring: Was the issue detected quickly?
```

3. **Generate Post-Mortem Analysis**

Create `post-mortem-analysis.md` with:

```markdown
# Post Mortem Analysis

**Analysis Date**: [Today's date]
**Issue**: [Description of failure/issue]
**Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
**First Occurred**: [Date if known]

## Executive Summary

[Brief description of the issue and its impact]

## Timeline of Events

| Time | Event | Actor | Outcome |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| [When] | [What happened] | [Who/what] | [Result] |

## Root Cause Analysis

*Analysis generated: [Timestamp]*
*Follow-up review date: [Date + 7 days]*
```

4. **Pattern Recognition**

If analyzing multiple issues, add:

```markdown
## Pattern Analysis

### Recurring Issues
| Pattern | Frequency | First Seen | Last Seen |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| [Pattern description] | [N times] | [Date] | [Date] |

### Common Root Causes
1. **[Root cause]**: Seen in [X]% of failures
2. **[Root cause]**: Seen in [Y]% of failures
```

5. **Severity Classification**

- **Critical**: System unusable, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major feature broken, significant delay
- **Medium**: Workaround available, moderate impact
- **Low**: Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ Root cause clearly identified
‚úÖ Specific, actionable recommendations provided
‚úÖ Clear ownership assigned for fixes
‚úÖ Success metrics defined
‚úÖ Prevention strategies documented

### FOCUS AREAS

When analyzing, pay special attention to:
- Repeated failures in the same area
- Issues that required manual intervention
- Problems that caused significant delays
- Failures in agent coordination
- Gaps in documentation

Remember: The goal is not to assign blame but to improve the system. Focus on systematic improvements that prevent future occurrences.
