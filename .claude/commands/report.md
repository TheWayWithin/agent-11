# PROGRESS REPORT GENERATION üìä

**Command**: `/report [since_date]`

**Arguments**: 
- `since_date` (optional): Date to report from (YYYY-MM-DD format). Defaults to last report date or 7 days ago.

## REPORT GENERATION PROTOCOL

You are generating a structured progress report for external stakeholders (BOS-AI or clients) based on project-plan.md and progress.md.

### EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Parse Arguments**
   - Extract since_date if provided
   - If not provided, look for last progress-report.md date
   - Default to 7 days ago if no previous report exists

2. **Gather Information**
   - Read project-plan.md for completed tasks
   - Read progress.md for issues and resolutions
   - Check git log for recent commits
   - Review any test results or metrics

3. **Generate Report Structure**

Create `progress-report.md` with the following format:

```markdown
# Progress Report

**Report Date**: [Today's date]
**Period**: [Since date] to [Today's date]
**Project**: AGENT-11 Development

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences summarizing overall progress and status]

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Completion Date | Impact |
|------|----------------|--------|
| [Task from project-plan.md] | [Date] | [Business value delivered] |

## Issues & Resolutions

| Issue | Date | Resolution | Status |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| [From progress.md] | [Date] | [How resolved] | ‚úÖ Resolved / ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress |

## Current Status

- **Overall Progress**: [On Track / At Risk / Behind Schedule]
- **Active Phase**: [Current phase from project-plan.md]
- **Blockers**: [Any current blockers]

## Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Development Velocity | [X] tasks/week | [Y] completed | üìà/üìâ/‚û°Ô∏è |
| Issue Resolution Time | <24 hours | [Actual] | üìà/üìâ/‚û°Ô∏è |
| Test Coverage | >80% | [If available] | üìà/üìâ/‚û°Ô∏è |

## Next Milestones

```

4. **Special Sections for BOS-AI Integration**

If BOS-AI documents detected in ideation folder, add:

```markdown
## Business Alignment

**Requirements Coverage**: [X]% of PRD requirements completed
**Vision Alignment**: [How development aligns with Vision and Mission.md]
**Next Business Milestone**: [From Strategic Roadmap]
```

5. **Quality Checks**
   - Ensure all dates are accurate
   - Verify task completion status
   - Cross-reference with git commits
   - Include only factual information

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ Report generated with accurate information
‚úÖ All completed tasks since last report included
‚úÖ Issues and resolutions documented
‚úÖ Clear next steps identified
‚úÖ Professional format suitable for stakeholders

### ERROR HANDLING

- If no project-plan.md exists: Report basic git activity
- If no progress.md exists: Focus on completed tasks only
- If no changes since last report: Generate "No Activity" report

Remember: This report may be the only visibility stakeholders have into the project. Make it comprehensive, accurate, and actionable.
