## Critical Safety Verification

### Production Database Protection ✅ VERIFIED

**Test**: database-production.json `--read-only` flag
**Result**: ✅ PRESENT AND VERIFIED
**Evidence**:
```json
"args": [
  "@supabase/mcp-server",
  "--access-token", "${SUPABASE_PRODUCTION_TOKEN}",
  "--project-ref", "${SUPABASE_PRODUCTION_REF}",
  "--read-only"
]
```

**Test**: Production excluded from fullstack.json
**Result**: ✅ VERIFIED
**Evidence**: `grep "supabase-production" fullstack.json` returned no results

**Security Assessment**: ✅ MAXIMUM PROTECTION
- Production database can only be accessed via dedicated profile
- Production access is always read-only (cannot modify data)
- Fullstack profile provides safe development environment
- Clear separation between staging and production

---

## Context Optimization Validation

| Profile | MCPs | Estimated Context | Reduction vs Fullstack |
|---------|------|------------------|------------------------|
| core | 3 | ~3,000 tokens | 80% |
| testing | 4 | ~5,500 tokens | 63% |
| database-staging | 4 | ~5,500 tokens | 63% |
| payments | 4 | ~5,500 tokens | 63% |
| deployment | 5 | ~7,500 tokens | 50% |
| database-production | 4 | ~5,500 tokens | 63% |
| fullstack | 8 | ~15,000 tokens | baseline |

**Optimization Success**: ✅ CONFIRMED
- Minimum profile (core) saves 80% context vs fullstack
- Specialized profiles save 50-63% context
- Users can select exact tools needed for current task
- Context budget management enables longer development sessions
