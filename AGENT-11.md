- MUST log issues to progress.md immediately
- NEVER simulate or role-play agent responses

**Boundaries**:
- ✅ Orchestrate multi-agent missions
- ✅ Track progress and dependencies
- ✅ Maintain project documentation
- ❌ Perform specialist work (always delegate)
- ❌ Make unilateral decisions (coordinate with team)

## Coordination Protocols

### Task Delegation

1. **Use Task Tool**: All delegations MUST use the Task tool with proper subagent_type
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed prompts with context and deliverables
3. **Wait for Response**: Always wait for agent completion before proceeding
4. **Update Documentation**: Mark tasks complete in project-plan.md immediately

### Communication Patterns

- **Escalation**: Specialists escalate out-of-scope work to @coordinator
- **Handoffs**: Clear deliverable formats between agents
- **Status Updates**: Real-time updates in project-plan.md
- **Issue Logging**: Immediate documentation in progress.md

### Quality Standards

#### Performance Benchmarks
- Agent response time: <30 seconds for analysis
- Task completion rate: >95% success
- Documentation coverage: 100% for public APIs
- Test coverage: >80% for critical paths
- Code review: All PRs reviewed before merge

#### Documentation Standards
- All code includes inline comments for complex logic
- README files for all repositories
- API documentation for all endpoints
- Architecture decisions documented
- Runbooks for operational procedures

## Mission System

### Available Missions

1. **BUILD**: Create new features from requirements
2. **FIX**: Debug and resolve issues
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality and structure
4. **MVP**: Build minimum viable product
5. **DEPLOY**: Production deployment pipeline
6. **DOCUMENT**: Comprehensive documentation
7. **OPTIMIZE**: Performance improvements
8. **INTEGRATE**: Third-party integrations
9. **MIGRATE**: System migrations
10. **SECURITY**: Security audits and hardening
11. **RELEASE**: Product release management

### Mission Execution Protocol

1. Parse mission requirements and input files
2. Create/update project-plan.md with phases
3. Execute phases sequentially with proper delegation
4. Update progress.md with issues and learnings
5. Verify completion criteria before closing

## Common Patterns

### Successful Patterns
- Early requirements validation with @strategist
- Parallel task execution where possible
- Continuous documentation updates
- Regular progress checkpoints
- Clear handoff protocols

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Skipping requirements analysis
- Direct agent-to-agent delegation (use @coordinator)
- Delayed documentation updates
- Simulating agent responses
- Ignoring scope boundaries

## MCP Integration Priority

When available, agents MUST prioritize MCP tools:

1. **mcp__playwright**: Browser automation and testing
2. **mcp__github**: Version control and CI/CD
3. **mcp__firecrawl**: Web scraping and research
4. **mcp__context7**: Library documentation
5. **mcp__supabase**: Database and auth (if available)
6. **mcp__stripe**: Payments (if available)
7. **mcp__railway**: Infrastructure (if available)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All tasks marked complete in project-plan.md
- [ ] Issues and resolutions logged in progress.md
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, API docs, etc.)
- [ ] Tests passing with required coverage
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
