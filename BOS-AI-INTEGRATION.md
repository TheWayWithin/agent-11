# BOS-AI + AGENT-11 Integration

## Overview

AGENT-11 seamlessly integrates with BOS-AI through document-based handoffs. BOS-AI handles business strategy and planning, while AGENT-11 executes technical development based on the requirements provided.

## How It Works

### 1. BOS-AI Creates Business Documents
BOS-AI generates comprehensive business documentation and places it in the `ideation/` folder of your AGENT-11 project:

- **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document (primary handoff document)
- **Vision and Mission.md** - Long-term product vision and company mission
- **Market and Client Research Template.md** - Target market analysis and user research
- **Client Success Blueprint.md** - Success metrics and support strategies
- **Positioning Statement Template.md** - Product positioning and differentiation
- **Strategic Roadmap_ Vision to Great.md** - Phased roadmap from MVP to scale
- **Brand Style Guide.md** - Visual identity and design guidelines

### 2. AGENT-11 Consumes Requirements
AGENT-11 agents read these documents to understand:
- What to build (PRD)
- Why it matters (Vision and Mission)
- Who it's for (Market Research)
- How users succeed (Client Success Blueprint)
- Market positioning (Positioning Statement)
- Future direction (Strategic Roadmap)
- Design standards (Brand Style Guide)

### 3. Development Execution
Use AGENT-11's mission system to execute based on BOS-AI's requirements:

```bash
# For new product development
/coord build ideation/PRD.md

# For MVP development with full context
/coord mvp ideation/PRD.md ideation/Vision\ and\ Mission.md

# For feature development with brand guidelines
/coord build ideation/PRD.md ideation/Brand\ Style\ Guide.md
```

### 4. Progress Reporting
AGENT-11 maintains progress in `project-plan.md` and `progress.md`, which BOS-AI can periodically review to track development status.

## Integration Benefits

- **Clear Separation**: Business strategy (BOS-AI) and technical execution (AGENT-11) remain independent
- **Complete Context**: All business documents available to development team
- **Automated Workflow**: Mission system consumes documents automatically
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking through standardized reports

## Quick Start

1. **BOS-AI Side**: Generate business documents and place in target project's `ideation/` folder
2. **AGENT-11 Side**: Run missions referencing the ideation documents
3. **Progress Tracking**: Check `project-plan.md` for status updates

## Example Workflow

```bash
# BOS-AI creates comprehensive requirements
ideation/
├── PRD.md                              # Core requirements
├── Vision and Mission.md               # Strategic vision
├── Market and Client Research Template.md  # User research
├── Client Success Blueprint.md         # Success metrics
├── Positioning Statement Template.md   # Market positioning
├── Strategic Roadmap_ Vision to Great.md  # Growth roadmap
└── Brand Style Guide.md               # Design standards

# AGENT-11 executes development
/coord mvp ideation/PRD.md ideation/Vision\ and\ Mission.md

# Progress tracked automatically
cat project-plan.md  # See development progress
cat progress.md      # See issues and resolutions
```

## No Complex Integration Required

This is a simple, document-based integration:
- No API connections needed
- No direct agent communication required
- No complex setup or configuration
- Just documents in folders

BOS-AI creates the business strategy, AGENT-11 executes the technical implementation. Simple, clean, effective.
