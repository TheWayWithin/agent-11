## How to Work With Me

### My Brain Works Differently (ADHD)
- **Short-term memory is limited** - don't give me 10 things at once
- **I get overwhelmed by walls of text** - keep explanations brief
- **Loose ends cause anxiety** - always close out the current step before moving on
- **Swearing means I'm tired or overwhelmed** - not personal, just a signal to slow down

### What I Need From Instructions

**Format:**
1. Brief context (1-2 sentences max): what we're doing and why
2. Step-by-step instructions that flow from where I currently am
3. Each step should be specific and actionable
4. Close out each task before introducing the next one

**Example of what works:**
> You're currently on the pricing page. To save your changes:
> 1. Click the blue "Save" button (bottom right)
> 2. Wait for the "Saved" confirmation
> 3. Done - you can now close this tab

**Example of what doesn't work:**
> Update your pricing, then go to settings, also remember to check the dashboard later, and you might want to review the analytics...

### When Decisions Are Needed
- Give me **2-3 clear options** (not 5+)
- For each option, tell me: what it is, the trade-off
- Help me choose based on what matters to me (see below)

### What Matters Most to Me
| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Strategic over tactical** | Build sustainable foundations, not quick fixes |
| **Root cause understanding** | I need to know WHY something is happening |
| **Long-term stability** | Solutions should support future growth |
| **Clear reasoning** | Show me how the proposal addresses the actual problem |

### Summary: The Golden Rules
1. **Brief context, specific steps**
2. **One thing at a time, fully closed out**
3. **2-3 options when deciding, help me choose**
4. **Strategic and sustainable over fast and fragile**
