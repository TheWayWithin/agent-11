## Project Requirements

### Valid Project Directory
AGENT-11 requires installation within a valid project directory. The installer detects:

‚úÖ **Git Repository**: `.git/` directory  
‚úÖ **Package Files**: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.  
‚úÖ **Source Code**: `.js`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.ts`, etc. files  
‚úÖ **Configuration Files**: `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, config files  
‚úÖ **Build Tools**: `Makefile`, `webpack.config.js`, etc.

### Examples of Valid Projects
```bash
# Node.js project
ls -la ~/my-app/
# .git/ package.json src/ public/

# Python project  
ls -la ~/data-analysis/
# .git/ requirements.txt main.py data/

# Go project
ls -la ~/api-server/
# .git/ go.mod main.go cmd/

# Generic project with source code
ls -la ~/website/
# .git/ index.html style.css scripts/
```

### Required Software
- **Claude Code**: Latest version must be installed and working
- **Bash Shell**: Available on macOS/Linux by default, Windows users need WSL
- **Project Directory Write Access**: Installer creates `.claude/agents/` in your project

### Minimum System Requirements
- **Storage**: 10MB free space (agents are lightweight text files)
- **Memory**: No additional memory requirements
- **Network**: Internet connection for initial download only

## System Requirements

### Supported Platforms

**Agents**: All 11 specialists  
**Install Time**: 4-5 minutes  
**Best For**: Production applications, complex projects, full product lifecycle

```bash
./deployment/scripts/install.sh full
```

### Minimal Squad
**Agents**: Strategist, Developer  
**Install Time**: 1-2 minutes  
**Best For**: Quick prototyping, focused development, resource constraints

```bash
./deployment/scripts/install.sh minimal
```

## Step-by-Step Project Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Verify it's a valid project
ls -la
# Should show: .git/, package.json, source files, etc.

# If no project yet, initialize one:
git init
echo '# My Project' > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 2: Install Project Squad

```bash
# From your project directory, run installer
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core
```

### Step 3: Verify Project Detection

The installer will show project detection:

```
üîç Detecting project context...
‚úÖ Git repository detected
‚úÖ Node.js project detected (package.json found)
‚úÖ Source code detected (src/ directory)
üìÅ Installing to: /your/project/.claude/agents/
```

### Step 4: Monitor Installation

The installer provides real-time feedback with project context:

```
üöÅ AGENT-11 Project Deployment System
=====================================

[INFO] Selected squad: core (4 agents)
[INFO] Project directory: /Users/you/my-startup-app
[INFO] Detected project type: Node.js application with React
[INFO] Validating project environment...

üéâ AGENT-11 Project Squad Deployed Successfully!
```

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code in Project

```bash
# If Claude Code is running
/exit

# Start fresh in your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

## Post-Installation Setup

### Verify Project Agent Detection

```bash
# In Claude Code (from your project directory)
/agents
```

You should see your project-specific agents:

```
Project agents (.claude/agents)
  strategist - Product strategy specialist (knows your project context)
  developer - Full-stack specialist (familiar with React/Node.js stack)
  tester - QA specialist (configured for Jest/RTL)
  operator - DevOps specialist (Node.js deployment ready)
```

### Test Project-Aware Functionality

```bash
# Test project understanding
@strategist What should we build next in this project?

# Test stack-aware development
@developer Add a new feature using our existing React/Node.js stack

# Test project-specific testing
@tester Create tests that fit our existing test structure
```

### Project Structure Verification

Check that project structure is correct:

```bash
# Verify project agents directory
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Should show your squad files:
# strategist.md
# developer.md  
# tester.md
# operator.md
```

## Verification

### Project Installation Success Checklist

- [ ] No error messages during installation
- [ ] Project type correctly detected
- [ ] "üéâ AGENT-11 Project Squad Deployed Successfully!" message shown
- [ ] Agents visible in Claude Code `/agents` command (when in project directory)
- [ ] Test agent responds with project context

# Should show YAML header:
# ---
# name: strategist
# description: Product strategy specialist with project context
# ---
```

### Project-Aware Functional Testing

```bash
@strategist What features should we prioritize in this project?
@developer How can we improve our existing codebase?
@tester What testing strategy fits our current setup?
@operator How should we deploy this specific project?
```

‚úÖ **Stack-Specific Knowledge**: Agents adapt to each project's technology stack  
‚úÖ **Clean Separation**: No global pollution or conflicting configurations  
‚úÖ **Independent Upgrades**: Upgrade squads per project without affecting others  

### Platform-Specific Notes

### All Platforms
- Project agents stored in `.claude/agents/` within each project
- Claude Code detects agents when started in project directory
- No global installation - everything is project-local

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Fails

**Error**: "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x deployment/scripts/install.sh
./deployment/scripts/install.sh core
```

**Error**: "No project detected" or "Not a valid project directory"
```bash
# Ensure you're in a valid project directory
pwd  # Should show your project path
ls -la  # Should show .git, package.json, source files, etc.

# If not a project, initialize one:
git init
echo '{}' > package.json  # or create appropriate project files
```

**Error**: "Cannot write to project directory"
```bash
# Check project directory permissions
ls -ld .
# Should show write permissions for user

# If permission issue:
sudo chown -R $USER .
```

### Agents Not Appearing

**Issue**: No agents in `/agents` list
```bash
# Restart Claude Code in project directory
/exit
cd /path/to/your/project
claude

# Check project agents directory
ls -la .claude/agents/
```

**Issue**: Agent files exist but not detected
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory where agents are installed
pwd
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Check file format
head -10 .claude/agents/strategist.md
# Must have YAML header with name field
```

### Agent Not Responding

**Issue**: Agent doesn't respond to @mentions
```bash
# Check exact agent name
/agents
# Use exact name shown in list
```

**Issue**: "Agent not found" error
```bash
# Verify file name matches agent name in YAML header
grep "name:" .claude/agents/strategist.md

# Ensure Claude Code is running from project directory
pwd  # Should show your project path
```

### Rollback Issues

**Issue**: Installation failed and cleanup needed
```bash
# Manual cleanup of project agents
rm -rf .claude/agents/

# Re-run installation
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow installation
```bash
# Check available disk space in project
df -h .
# Should have at least 10MB free
```

**Issue**: Agents slow to respond
- This is normal for first interaction after installation
- Subsequent responses should be faster

## Advanced Installation Options

### Custom Project Agent Selection

```bash
# Install only specific agents to your project
# Navigate to your project first
cd /path/to/your/project

# Then install specific agents manually
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp /path/to/agent-11/project/agents/specialists/strategist.md .claude/agents/
cp /path/to/agent-11/project/agents/specialists/developer.md .claude/agents/
```

### Different Project Agent Directory

```bash
# Agents are always project-local in .claude/agents/
# This ensures isolation and project-specific context
# No global installation options by design
```

### Development Installation

```bash
# For AGENT-11 developers working on a project
cd /path/to/your/project
./path/to/agent-11/deployment/scripts/install.sh core --dev
# Links files instead of copying (changes reflect immediately)
```
