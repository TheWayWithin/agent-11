# BOS-AI ↔ AGENT-11 Integration Standards

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Production Ready

## Overview

This document defines the technical standards, document formats, schemas, and conventions for the BOS-AI ↔ AGENT-11 integration system. All integration components must comply with these standards to ensure compatibility, reliability, and maintainability.

## Document Format Specifications

### Universal Document Structure

All integration documents follow a consistent structure:

```markdown
---
[YAML Frontmatter - Metadata]
---

# Document Title

[Document Content in Markdown]
```

**Requirements:**
- YAML frontmatter enclosed in `---` delimiters
- Valid YAML syntax with proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Markdown content following CommonMark specification
- UTF-8 encoding for all text files
- Unix line endings (LF) preferred

### YAML Frontmatter Standards

## Naming Conventions

### Project Identification

**Project IDs**: 
- Format: `proj_XXX` where XXX is a zero-padded sequential number
- Examples: `proj_001`, `proj_042`, `proj_123`
- Range: `proj_001` to `proj_999`

**Bundle Versions**:
- Format: `bundle-vX.Y.Z` where X.Y.Z follows semantic versioning
- Examples: `bundle-v1.0.0`, `bundle-v2.1.3`
- Directory naming: `bundle-v1.2.0/`

### File Naming

**Document Files**:
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `product-requirements.md`
- Standard names: `prd.md`, `context.md`, `vision.md`, `roadmap.md`
- Include document type in filename when needed: `brand-guidelines.md`

**Report Files**:
- Format: `{type}-{date}-{project-id}.md`
- Examples: `weekly-2025-01-29-proj001.md`, `milestone-2025-02-15-proj001.md`
- Critical reports: `critical-issue-2025-01-29-1430-proj001.md`

**Change Request Files**:
- Format: `cr-{date}-{sequential}-{brief-description}.md`  
- Examples: `cr-2025-01-29-001-add-oauth-support.md`
- Sequential numbering resets yearly: `cr-2025-01-29-001`, `cr-2025-01-30-002`

## Version Control Standards

### Semantic Versioning

All documents and bundles follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

**MAJOR version** increments for:
- Breaking changes that require development restart
- Complete requirement rewrites
- Fundamental scope or technology changes

**MINOR version** increments for:
- New features or requirements added
- Scope expansions that don't break existing work
- Significant clarifications or enhancements

**PATCH version** increments for:
- Bug fixes and corrections
- Typo fixes and formatting improvements
- Minor clarifications that don't change meaning

### Version Synchronization

**Bundle Versioning Rules:**
1. Bundle version = highest document version in the bundle
2. All documents must have compatible versions (no major version conflicts)
3. Bundle version increments when any document version increments
4. Change log must document all version changes

**Example Version Evolution:**
```yaml
# Initial bundle
bundle_version: "1.0.0"
documents:
  prd: "1.0.0"
  context: "1.0.0"
  vision: "1.0.0"

# After PRD update (minor change)
bundle_version: "1.1.0"  # Bundle follows highest document version
documents:
  prd: "1.1.0"      # Updated with new features
  context: "1.0.0"  # Unchanged
  vision: "1.0.0"   # Unchanged

# After major PRD rewrite
bundle_version: "2.0.0"  # Major version bump
documents:
  prd: "2.0.0"      # Major rewrite
  context: "1.1.0"  # Updated for compatibility 
  vision: "2.0.0"   # Updated for alignment
```

### Change Tracking

**Change Log Format:**
```yaml
change_log:
  - version: "1.2.3"
    date: "2025-01-29T15:30:00Z"
    changes:
      - "Added real-time notification requirements"
      - "Updated OAuth provider preferences"
      - "Fixed typo in success metrics section"
    files_modified:
      - "core-requirements/prd.md"
      - "core-requirements/client-blueprint.md"
    impact: "minor"           # major, minor, patch
    author: "BOS-AI"
    approved_by: "product-owner@company.com"
    migration_notes: "No breaking changes, existing development can continue"
```

## Quality Metrics

### Document Quality Standards

**Content Quality Scoring (0-100):**
- **Completeness**: All required sections present and populated (30 points)
- **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous language and structure (25 points)
- **Detail Level**: Sufficient detail for implementation (20 points)
- **Consistency**: Consistent formatting and terminology (15 points)
- **Accuracy**: Information is correct and up-to-date (10 points)

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Acceptable**: 75 points
- **Good Quality**: 85 points
- **Excellent Quality**: 95 points

### Validation Standards

**Schema Validation Requirements:**
- 100% compliance with JSON Schema definitions
- All required fields present and properly typed
- No schema violations or warnings for production bundles

**Content Validation Requirements:**
- Minimum word counts met for all sections
- All cross-references resolve correctly
- External links validated and accessible
- No spelling or grammar errors in critical sections

**Business Logic Validation:**
- Requirements feasibility assessment passes
- Success metrics are measurable and specific
- Dependencies clearly identified and realistic
- Risk assessment complete and reasonable

### Performance Standards

**Validation Performance Targets:**
- Bundle validation: <30 seconds for typical bundle
- Large bundle validation: <2 minutes for bundles >10MB
- Parallel validation: 50% performance improvement with 4 cores

**Memory Usage Limits:**
- Validation process: <256MB RAM for typical bundle
- Large bundle processing: <512MB RAM maximum
- Background processes: <64MB RAM each

**Storage Requirements:**
- Bundle storage: <50MB per typical bundle
- Archive retention: 90 days for old versions
- Log retention: 30 days for debug logs, 90 days for audit logs

## Schema Definitions

### JSON Schema Standards

All document schemas are defined using [JSON Schema Draft 7](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-7).

**Schema File Naming:**
- Format: `{document-type}-schema.json`
- Location: `integration-bridge/config/schemas/`
- Examples: `prd-schema.json`, `context-schema.json`

**Schema Structure Example:**
```json
