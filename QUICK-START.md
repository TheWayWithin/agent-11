# AGENT-11 Quick Start Guide

## Zero to Deployed in Under 5 Minutes

Welcome to AGENT-11! This guide gets you from curious to deployed to productive in under 5 minutes. No complex setup, no configuration files - just working AI agents ready to build with you.

## One-Line Installation

### Option 1: Remote Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Core Squad (4 agents) - Recommended for most users
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core

# Full Squad (11 agents) - For complex projects  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full

# Minimal Squad (2 agents) - For quick prototyping
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s minimal
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository first
git clone https://github.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11.git && cd agent-11

# Then run the installer
./deployment/scripts/install.sh core
```

**That's it!** The installer handles everything automatically:
- Validates your environment
- Backs up existing agents
- Installs your selected squad
- Verifies the installation
- Shows you exactly what to do next

## What You Get

### Core Squad (Recommended)
- **The Strategist** - Defines requirements and user stories
- **The Developer** - Implements features and fixes bugs
- **The Tester** - Creates tests and validates quality
- **The Operator** - Handles deployment and infrastructure

### Installation Time: 2-3 minutes

## First Commands

After installation, you'll see success confirmation and your first commands:

```bash
# 1. Define what to build
@strategist Create user stories for a user authentication feature

# 2. Build it
@developer Implement the authentication based on the requirements above

# 3. Test it
@tester Validate the implementation and create test cases

# 4. Ship it
@operator Deploy to production when tests pass
```

## Verification

Confirm your agents are working:

```bash
# In Claude Code, check your agents
/agents

# You should see your squad listed under "Project agents"
```

Test an agent:
```bash
@strategist Hello! What can you help me build today?
```

## Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:
- ‚úÖ Green success messages during installation
- üéâ "AGENT-11 Squad Deployed Successfully!" message
- üìÅ Agents listed when you run `/agents` in Claude Code
- üöÄ Agents respond when you use @agentname commands

## Common Issues (Quick Fixes)

### "No agents showing up"
```bash
# Restart Claude Code
/exit
claude
```

### "Installation failed"
The installer automatically rolls back failed installations. Just run it again:
```bash
./deployment/scripts/install.sh core
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x ./deployment/scripts/install.sh
./deployment/scripts/install.sh core
```
