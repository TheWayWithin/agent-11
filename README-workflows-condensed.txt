### Workflow Details

**1. MVP Development** - Build production-ready MVP in 1-3 days
- Full stack: auth, payments, testing, deployment
- Example: [LLM.txt Mastery](https://llmtxtmastery.com) built in 3 days
- Cost: $5-10 in API usage

**2. Bug Fixes** - Debug and resolve production issues in 2-4 hours
- Root cause analysis, fix implementation, regression tests
- Cost: $0.50-1.50 in API usage

**3. Design Review** - Comprehensive UI/UX audit in 1-2 hours
- 7-phase RECON Protocol: Interaction, responsive, visual, accessibility, robustness, performance
- Deliverables: Issues classified by severity, screenshots, compliance report
- Cost: $0.50-1 in API usage

**4. Feature Development** - Build complete features in 4-8 hours
- Strategist → Architect → Developer → Tester → Documenter workflow
- Deliverables: Code, tests, API docs, deployment checklist
- Cost: $1-3 in API usage

**5. Security Audit** - Comprehensive security review in 2-3 hours
- OWASP Top 10, dependency scanning, compliance validation (SOC2, GDPR)
- Deliverables: Vulnerability report, fixes, security documentation
- Cost: $2-4 in API usage

**6. Code Refactoring** - Improve code quality in 2-4 hours
- Technical debt reduction, performance improvements
- All tests pass (no functionality changes)
- Cost: $0.75-2 in API usage

**7. Performance Optimization** - Tune application performance in 3-6 hours
- Bottleneck identification, query optimization, caching strategy
- Deliverables: Before/after benchmarks, performance report
- Cost: $1.50-3 in API usage

**8. Production Deployment** - Safe deployment in 1-2 hours
- Pre-deployment tests, zero-downtime deploy, monitoring, rollback plan
- Deliverables: Live deployment, smoke tests, runbook
- Cost: $0.50-1 in API usage
