## What is AGENT-11?

AGENT-11 deploys 11 specialized AI agents to your project, orchestrating them through proven workflows to build production-ready software. Think of it as **hiring an elite development team** - except they're AI agents working together seamlessly.

**Instead of prompting Claude Code for every task, AGENT-11 provides:**
- 🎯 **Specialized Agents** - Each with domain expertise (requirements, architecture, coding, testing, design, etc.)
- 🎖️ **Coordinated Workflows** - 20 pre-built missions that orchestrate multiple agents automatically
- 🧠 **Persistent Context** - Knowledge that survives across sessions and agent handoffs
- ✅ **Quality Assurance** - Built-in testing, verification, and security protocols

### How AGENT-11 Works with BOS-AI

## 📊 Mission Progress Tracking System

AGENT-11 uses a dual-file tracking system: **project-plan.md** (forward-looking roadmap) and **progress.md** (backward-looking changelog with complete issue history). Unlike traditional changelogs that only record final solutions, progress.md documents ALL fix attempts including failures, enabling future issues to be solved faster by learning from past mistakes.

**Key Benefits**:
- Complete audit trail of what was tried and why it failed
- Root cause analysis and prevention strategies for every issue
- Searchable lessons repository that compounds over time

[→ Complete Tracking Guide](templates/progress-template.md)

## 🔄 Project Lifecycle Management

AGENT-11 includes a three-tier cleanup strategy to prevent tracking files from growing unmanageably large: **Milestone Transition** (archive completed work every 2-4 weeks), **Project Completion** (comprehensive archive when done), or **Continue Active Work** (no cleanup needed). All lessons from progress.md are extracted to a searchable `lessons/` repository organized by category (security, performance, architecture, process), ensuring knowledge compounds across missions while keeping context lean.

**Key Benefits**:
- Prevents context pollution (tracking files stay under 200 lines vs 20,000+)
- Searchable lessons repository that compounds knowledge over time
- Agents stay focused on current mission, not buried in historical details

AGENT-11 uses separation of duties: THE TESTER analyzes code and creates test plans (read-only for integrity), @developer implements tests based on specs, THE TESTER executes and validates. For critical releases, **SENTINEL Mode** activates a 7-phase protocol: perimeter establishment, functional reconnaissance, visual regression, cross-browser operations, performance patrol, stress testing, and accessibility verification (WCAG AA+). Uses mcp__playwright for E2E, Jest/Vitest for unit tests, with comprehensive security validation on every run.

**Key Benefits**:
- Zero bugs reach production (objective testing prevents confirmation bias)
- 80%+ coverage on critical paths, 100% on security-sensitive code
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with visual regression detection

## 🚀 Your First Mission

**Use `/coord` to orchestrate multi-agent missions** or `@agent` for direct specialist access. All missions follow pattern: `/coord [mission] [input-file.md]`.

**Quick examples**: `/coord build requirements.md` | `/coord fix bug-report.md` | `/coord mvp vision.md`
