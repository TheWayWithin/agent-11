## üéØ Mission Briefing

You're a solo founder with a vision. You need to build fast, ship quality, and compete with funded teams. **AGENT-11** deploys your elite squad to work on a specific project - each project gets its own specialized team that understands your project context perfectly.

### Your Squad Includes:
- üéØ **The Strategist** - Product vision and roadmaps
- üèóÔ∏è **The Architect** - Bulletproof technical decisions  
- üíª **The Developer** - Ship code at light speed
- ‚úÖ **The Tester** - Zero bugs reach production (NEW: SENTINEL Mode)
- üé® **The Designer** - Interfaces that convert (NEW: RECON Protocol + Design Review)
- üìö **The Documenter** - Knowledge captured perfectly
- üöÄ **The Operator** - Deploy with confidence
- üí¨ **The Support** - Users become advocates
- üìä **The Analyst** - Data drives decisions
- üìà **The Marketer** - Growth on autopilot
- üéñÔ∏è **The Coordinator** - Mission commander (NEW: PARALLEL STRIKE)

## üìã Prerequisites

**AGENT-11 requires a project context to deploy.** Your directory needs at least ONE of:

- üîß **Git repository** (recommended): `git init`
- üìÑ **README file**: `README.md`
- üì¶ **Package file**: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Any project indicator**: `.gitignore`, source files, or documentation

### Quick Project Setup

```bash
# For new projects - create and initialize:
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# For existing folders - just initialize:
cd /path/to/existing/folder
git init  # This is usually all you need!

# For greenfield projects with ideation docs:
cd /path/to/project-with-ideation
git init && echo "# Project Name" > README.md
```

## üöÄ Project-Only Deployment

**Project-Local Agents ¬∑ No Global Pollution ¬∑ Clean Isolation**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project (required)
cd /path/to/your/project

# Step 2: Ensure project context exists (if not already)
git init  # Quick fix if deployment fails with "no project detected"

# Step 3: Deploy your squad
# Core Squad (4 agents) - Recommended for most projects
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core

# Full Squad (11 agents) - For complex projects  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full

# Minimal Squad (2 agents) - For quick prototyping
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s minimal
```

**Project-focused by design!** The installer:
- ‚úÖ Detects your project type and context
- ‚úÖ Creates project-local `.claude/agents/` directory
- ‚úÖ Installs your selected squad with project understanding
- ‚ùå Fails gracefully if no project context found (with helpful guidance)
- ‚úÖ Shows you exactly what to do next

**[üìñ See Complete Project Setup Guide ‚Üí](QUICK-START.md)**

## ‚úÖ Verify Your Project Deployment

```bash
# Restart Claude Code in your project directory
/exit && claude

# List your project-local agents
/agents

# Test your first specialist (knows your project context)
@strategist What should we build first in this project?
```

### üîå MCP Integration Setup (Highly Recommended)

MCPs (Model Context Protocol) give your agents superpowers. Here's how to set them up correctly:

#### Step 1: Install Required MCP Packages
```bash
# Install globally (required for Claude Code to find them)
npm install -g @playwright/mcp                      # Browser automation
npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp               # Documentation lookup
npm install -g firecrawl-mcp                       # Web scraping
npm install -g @edjl/github-mcp                    # GitHub integration (uses GITHUB_TOKEN)
npm install -g @supabase/mcp-server-supabase       # Official Supabase MCP
npm install -g figma-developer-mcp                 # Design tools
```

#### Step 2: Configure API Keys
```bash
# Copy the template (created during installation)
cp .env.mcp.template .env.mcp

# Edit .env.mcp to add your API keys
nano .env.mcp  # or: code .env.mcp
```

Required API keys for full functionality:
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - [Create GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` & `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` - From Supabase dashboard
- `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` - For documentation lookup
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - For web scraping

#### Step 3: Run MCP Setup
```bash
# Use the v2 script with correct package names
./project/deployment/scripts/mcp-setup-v2.sh

# Or if in project directory:
bash .claude/deployment/scripts/mcp-setup-v2.sh
```

#### Step 4: Restart Claude Code
```bash
# Exit Claude Code
/exit

# Restart in your project directory
claude
```

#### Step 5: Verify MCPs are Working
After restart, check for MCP tools:
- Look for tools prefixed with `mcp__`
- Example: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
- Run: `claude mcp list` to see connection status

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **"Failed to connect"** - Normal before restart, exit and restart Claude Code
- **Wrong package names** - Use the exact names listed above, not @modelcontextprotocol/*
- **Missing packages** - Install globally with npm install -g
- **API key issues** - Verify keys in .env.mcp are correct

See [Complete MCP Guide](project/field-manual/mcp-integration.md) for advanced configuration.

## üöÄ Your First Mission

### Option 1: Manual Coordination
```bash
# 1. Define requirements
@strategist Create user stories for a user authentication feature

# 2. Build it
@developer Implement authentication based on the requirements above

# 3. Test it
@tester Validate the authentication implementation

# 4. Ship it
@operator Deploy to production when tests pass
```

### Option 2: Command System (NEW!) üéñÔ∏è
```bash
# Execute predefined missions with a single command
/coord build requirements.md

# Or start interactively
/coord

# Have strategic conversations with specialists
/meeting @strategist "product roadmap planning"
/meeting @architect "system scalability concerns"

# NEW: Design Review System
/design-review    # Comprehensive UI/UX audit of current changes
/recon           # UI/UX reconnaissance assessment
@design-review   # Dedicated design review specialist
```

The `/coord` command activates THE COORDINATOR to orchestrate complex multi-agent missions automatically. The `/meeting` command enables natural conversations with specialists for brainstorming and strategic planning. The **NEW Design Review System** provides world-class UI/UX audits using the RECON Protocol with Playwright automation. Choose from predefined missions like BUILD, FIX, MVP, or create your own.

## üéØ How to Execute Missions

### Mission Command Syntax
All missions follow the same execution pattern:
```bash
/coord [mission-name] [input-file.md]
```

### Your First Mission (5 Minutes)
Let's walk through executing your first mission step-by-step:

**Step 1: Choose Your Mission**
- **New Project**: Use `dev-setup` mission with ideation.md
- **Existing Project**: Use `dev-alignment` mission (no input file needed)
- **Build Features**: Use `build` mission with requirements.md

**Step 2: Prepare Input File** 
```bash
# Copy the appropriate template
cp templates/mission-inputs/ideation.md ./my-project-ideation.md

# Edit with your project details
# Fill out all sections with your specific requirements
```

**Step 3: Execute Mission**
```bash
/coord dev-setup my-project-ideation.md
```

**Step 4: Monitor Progress**
Watch for these real-time indicators:
- ‚úÖ **Task Completion**: Each agent marks their work complete
- üìã **File Creation**: New files appear in your project
- üîÑ **Agent Handoffs**: Coordination between specialists
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Issues Flagged**: Problems automatically escalated

**Step 5: Review Results**
Check these files for mission outcomes:
- `project-plan.md` - Strategic roadmap with completed tasks
- `progress.md` - Detailed log of decisions and issues
- `architecture.md` - Technical system design (if applicable)

### Input File Preparation

**Template Locations**:
- `templates/mission-inputs/requirements.md` - For BUILD missions
- `templates/mission-inputs/vision.md` - For MVP missions  
- `templates/mission-inputs/bug-report.md` - For FIX missions
- `templates/mission-inputs/ideation.md` - For DEV-SETUP missions

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] All required sections completed
- [ ] Specific, measurable requirements
- [ ] Clear success criteria defined
- [ ] Business context provided
- [ ] Technical constraints identified

### Real-Time Progress Monitoring

**Watch These Indicators**:
```bash
# Mission status updates appear as:
üéØ Mission: BUILD requirements.md [STARTED]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @strategist analyzing requirements... [IN PROGRESS]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @architect designing system... [QUEUED]  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @developer implementing features... [QUEUED]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @tester validating implementation... [QUEUED]

# Completion signals:
‚úÖ @strategist: Requirements analysis complete
‚úÖ @architect: System architecture designed  
‚úÖ @developer: Core features implemented
‚úÖ @tester: All tests passing
üéØ Mission: BUILD requirements.md [COMPLETE]
```

**Progress Files Updated Live**:
- `project-plan.md` - Tasks marked complete [x] as they finish
- `progress.md` - Issues, solutions, and lessons logged immediately  
- `handoff-notes.md` - Context passed between agents

### Recovery & Troubleshooting

**If Mission Stalls**:
1. **Check Progress Files**: Review `progress.md` for logged issues
2. **Resume Mission**: Re-run the same command to continue
3. **Escalate Issues**: Complex problems automatically flagged to @coordinator

**Common Issues & Solutions**:
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Input file not found" | Wrong file path | Use absolute path: `/full/path/to/file.md` |
| "Missing requirements" | Incomplete template | Fill all sections in input file |
| "Agent timeout" | Complex analysis | Re-run command - work continues from checkpoint |
| "Conflicting dependencies" | Technical constraints | Check `progress.md` for resolution steps |

**Emergency Commands**:
```bash
/coord status              # Check current mission status
/coord resume [mission]    # Continue paused mission
/report today             # Generate progress summary
```

### Mission Success Patterns

**High-Success Missions Include**:
- ‚úÖ **Complete Input Files**: All template sections filled with specific details
- ‚úÖ **Clear Objectives**: Specific, measurable goals defined
- ‚úÖ **Realistic Scope**: MVP-focused feature sets

**[üìñ Architecture SOP ‚Üí](project/field-manual/architecture-sop.md)** | **[üìã Template ‚Üí](templates/architecture.md)**

## üß† Context Preservation System (NEW!)

**Revolutionary context management that eliminates rework and accelerates workflows:**

### Battle-Tested Results
- **87.5% Reduction in Rework** - No more repeating discoveries or losing insights
- **37.5% Faster Multi-Agent Workflows** - Seamless handoffs between specialists  
- **Zero Context Loss** - Mission-wide knowledge accumulation across all agents

### Three Mandatory Context Files
Every AGENT-11 deployment automatically creates:

- **üìã agent-context.md** - Mission-wide findings accumulation
  - Key discoveries, technical decisions, and insights
  - Shared knowledge base that grows throughout the mission
  - Prevents duplicate analysis and research

- **ü§ù handoff-notes.md** - Agent-to-agent communication
  - Specialist handoffs with specific recommendations  
  - Status updates and context for next agent in the workflow
  - Maintains conversation continuity across agent switches

- **üèõÔ∏è evidence-repository.md** - Centralized artifact storage
  - Code examples, configurations, and implementation details
  - Screenshots, logs, and debugging evidence
  - Reference materials and external resources

### How It Works
1. **Agents Read First** - Every agent automatically reads context files before starting tasks
2. **Mission-Wide Accumulation** - Findings and insights build up across the entire mission
3. **Seamless Handoffs** - Agents update handoff notes for the next specialist  
4. **Zero Setup Required** - Templates automatically installed during deployment

### Automatic Template Installation
```bash
# Context templates are installed automatically with your squad:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/project/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core

# Your project now includes:
# ‚úÖ .claude/context-templates/agent-context.md
# ‚úÖ .claude/context-templates/handoff-notes.md  
# ‚úÖ .claude/context-templates/evidence-repository.md
```

**This system transforms chaotic multi-agent coordination into a seamless collaborative experience where every specialist builds on previous work instead of starting from scratch.**

## üîå MCP Integration

**Your agents leverage powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for enhanced capabilities:**

### Quick MCP Setup (IMPORTANT: Use Correct Package Names)
```bash
# 1. Install MCP packages globally (REQUIRED)
npm install -g @playwright/mcp                      # NOT @modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright
npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp               # NOT @context7/mcp-server
npm install -g firecrawl-mcp                       # NOT @mendable/firecrawl-mcp
npm install -g @edjl/github-mcp                    # NOT github-mcp-custom or @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
npm install -g @supabase/mcp-server-supabase       # NOT supabase-mcp (community package)

# 2. Configure API keys
cp .env.mcp.template .env.mcp
nano .env.mcp  # Add your API keys

# 3. Run setup with v2 script (has correct package names)
./project/deployment/scripts/mcp-setup-v2.sh

# 4. RESTART Claude Code (CRITICAL!)
/exit
claude  # Restart in your project directory

# 5. Verify MCPs are connected
claude mcp list  # Should show "Connected" not "Failed to connect"
```
