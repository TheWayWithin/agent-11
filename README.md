## 🎯 Mission Briefing

You're a solo founder with a vision. You need to build fast, ship quality, and compete with funded teams. **AGENT-11** deploys your elite squad to work on a specific project - each project gets its own specialized team that understands your project context perfectly.

### Your Squad Includes:
- 🎯 **The Strategist** - Product vision and roadmaps
- 🏗️ **The Architect** - Bulletproof technical decisions  
- 💻 **The Developer** - Ship code at light speed
- ✅ **The Tester** - Zero bugs reach production
- 🎨 **The Designer** - Interfaces that convert
- 📚 **The Documenter** - Knowledge captured perfectly
- 🚀 **The Operator** - Deploy with confidence
- 💬 **The Support** - Users become advocates
- 📊 **The Analyst** - Data drives decisions
- 📈 **The Marketer** - Growth on autopilot
- 🎖️ **The Coordinator** - Mission commander

## 🚀 Project-Only Deployment

**Project-Local Agents · No Global Pollution · Clean Isolation**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project (required)
cd /path/to/your/project

# Step 2: Deploy your squad
# Core Squad (4 agents) - Recommended for most projects
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core

# Full Squad (11 agents) - For complex projects  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full

# Minimal Squad (2 agents) - For quick prototyping
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s minimal
```

**Project-focused by design!** The installer automatically:
- ✅ Detects your project type and context
- ✅ Creates project-local `.claude/agents/` directory
- ✅ Installs your selected squad with project understanding
- ✅ Verifies project compatibility
- ✅ Shows you exactly what to do next

**[📖 See Complete Project Setup Guide →](QUICK-START.md)**

## ✅ Verify Your Project Deployment

```bash
# Restart Claude Code in your project directory
/exit && claude

# List your project-local agents
/agents

# Test your first specialist (knows your project context)
@strategist What should we build first in this project?
```

## 🚀 Your First Mission

### Option 1: Manual Coordination
```bash
# 1. Define requirements
@strategist Create user stories for a user authentication feature

# 2. Build it
@developer Implement authentication based on the requirements above

# 3. Test it
@tester Validate the authentication implementation

# 4. Ship it
@operator Deploy to production when tests pass
```

### Option 2: Mission Command (NEW!) 🎖️
```bash
# Execute predefined missions with a single command
/coord build requirements.md

# Or start interactively
/coord
```

The `/coord` command activates THE COORDINATOR to orchestrate complex multi-agent missions automatically. Choose from predefined missions like BUILD, FIX, MVP, or create your own. [Learn more →](field-manual/coordinator-commands.md)
