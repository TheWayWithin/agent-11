## Agent Basics

### Interacting with Agents

```bash
# Basic agent interaction
@agentname Your instruction or question

# Example
@strategist Plan a user authentication feature
@developer Implement the authentication system
@tester Create test cases for authentication
```

### Agent Communication Patterns

**Direct Commands**
```bash
@developer Create a REST API for user management
```

**Context Sharing**
```bash
@strategist Define requirements for a todo app
@developer Based on the requirements above, implement the todo app
@tester Review the implementation above and create comprehensive tests
```

**Collaborative Problem Solving**
```bash
@coordinator Plan the development of a new feature
# Coordinator will orchestrate other agents as needed
```

## Core Squad Workflows

The Core Squad (Strategist, Developer, Tester, Operator) forms a complete development pipeline:

### Workflow 1: Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Strategic Planning
@strategist Create user stories for [feature name]

# 2. Development
@developer Implement [feature name] based on the requirements above

# 3. Quality Assurance
@tester Create comprehensive tests for the [feature name] implementation

# 4. Deployment
@operator Set up deployment pipeline for the new feature
```

### Workflow 2: Bug Fixing

```bash
# 1. Analysis
@strategist Analyze this bug report and define acceptance criteria for the fix

# 2. Investigation & Fix
@developer Debug and fix the issue described above

# 3. Validation
@tester Verify the bug fix and create regression tests

# 4. Release
@operator Deploy the bug fix to production
```

### Workflow 3: Project Initialization

```bash
# 1. Project Definition
@strategist Define the scope and requirements for [project name]

# 2. Architecture Planning
@developer Design the technical architecture for the project

# 3. Testing Strategy
@tester Create a comprehensive testing strategy for the project

# 4. Infrastructure Planning
@operator Plan the deployment and infrastructure requirements
```

## Individual Agent Capabilities

### The Strategist

# Code review
@developer Review this code and suggest improvements: [paste code]

# Architecture decisions
@developer Recommend the best database choice for a real-time chat application

# Debugging assistance
@developer Help me debug this error: [error message and context]
```

### The Tester

```bash
# Test case creation
@tester Create comprehensive test cases for user registration functionality

# Test automation
@tester Write automated tests for this API endpoint: [endpoint details]

# Quality review
@tester Review this feature and identify potential edge cases

# Performance testing
@tester Design performance tests for a web application handling 10k users
```

### The Operator
**Specializes in**: DevOps, deployment, infrastructure, monitoring

```bash
# Deployment setup
@operator Set up CI/CD pipeline for a React/Node.js application

# Infrastructure planning
@operator Design AWS infrastructure for a scalable web application

# Monitoring setup
@operator Configure monitoring and alerting for production services

# Performance optimization
@operator Optimize server performance for high-traffic application
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Using the Coordinator (Full Squad)

The Coordinator orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows:

```bash
# Complex project management
@coordinator Plan and execute the development of a social media platform

# Feature coordination
@coordinator Coordinate the team to implement real-time notifications

# Crisis management
@coordinator We have a production incident affecting user logins. Coordinate response.
```

### Agent Handoffs

Agents can reference each other's work for seamless collaboration:

```bash
@strategist Define API requirements for user management
@architect Review the requirements above and design the system architecture
@developer Implement the API based on the architecture design
@tester Create integration tests for the API implementation
@operator Set up deployment for the new API service
```

### Parallel Workflows

Run multiple workflows simultaneously:

```bash
# Frontend track
@designer Create mockups for the user dashboard
@developer Implement the frontend based on the mockups

# Backend track (parallel)
@architect Design the backend API structure
@developer Implement the backend API

# Quality track (parallel)
@tester Prepare test strategies for both frontend and backend
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Communication

**Good**: `@developer Create a user authentication system with email/password login, JWT tokens, and password reset functionality`

**Better**: `@developer Create a user authentication system with these requirements: [paste strategist's output]`

### 2. Context Sharing

Always reference previous outputs when building on earlier work:

```bash
@strategist Define requirements for a blog platform
@developer Based on the requirements above, create the database schema
@tester Using the schema above, create database testing strategies
```

### 3. Incremental Development

Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces:

```bash
# Phase 1
@strategist Define MVP features for the blog platform
@developer Implement core blogging functionality

# Phase 2
@strategist Define advanced features (comments, social sharing)
@developer Implement advanced features

# Phase 3
@strategist Plan optimization and scaling requirements
@developer Implement performance optimizations
```

### 4. Validation Loops

Always validate work before moving forward:

```bash
@developer Implement user authentication
@tester Validate the authentication implementation
@developer Fix any issues found by the tester
@operator Deploy only after tester approval
```

## Common Workflows

### New Project Setup

```bash
@strategist Define project scope and requirements for [project name]
@architect Design high-level system architecture 
@developer Set up project structure and core infrastructure
@tester Create testing framework and initial test suite
@operator Set up development and staging environments
```

### Feature Addition

```bash
@strategist Analyze requirements for [new feature]
@designer Create UI/UX designs for the feature
@developer Implement the feature with the designs
@tester Create comprehensive test coverage
@operator Deploy to staging for validation
```

### Bug Investigation

```bash
@analyst Investigate user reports about [issue description]
@developer Debug and identify root cause
@tester Create regression tests to prevent recurrence
@developer Implement fix with test coverage
@operator Deploy fix with monitoring
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
@analyst Identify performance bottlenecks in the application
@architect Design optimization strategy
@developer Implement performance improvements
@tester Validate performance gains
@operator Monitor production performance metrics
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Agent Personalities

Customize agents for your specific domain:

```bash
@developer [Acting as a mobile app developer] Implement iOS user authentication
@tester [Focus on accessibility testing] Review this UI for accessibility compliance
```

### Domain-Specific Workflows

Adapt workflows for your industry:

**E-commerce Project**:
```bash
@strategist Define user journey for checkout process
@developer Implement payment processing with Stripe
@tester Create PCI compliance testing suite
@operator Set up secure payment infrastructure
```

**Data Science Project**:
```bash
@analyst Define data requirements and success metrics
@developer Implement data pipeline and ML models
@tester Create model validation and data quality tests
@operator Deploy ML models with monitoring
```

### Quality Gates

Implement quality checkpoints:

```bash
@developer Implement feature X
@tester [Quality Gate] Validate implementation meets requirements
# Only proceed if tester approves
@operator Deploy to production
```

### Documentation Workflows

Keep documentation current:

```bash
@developer Implement new API endpoint
@documenter Create API documentation for the new endpoint
@tester Validate documentation accuracy with real tests
```

## Troubleshooting Agent Usage

### Agent Not Responding

```bash
# Check agent name
/agents

# Use exact name from list
@strategist (not @strategy or @strategic)
```

### Poor Agent Performance

```bash
# Provide more context
@developer Create user auth
# Better:
@developer Create user authentication system with email/password, JWT tokens, session management, and password reset functionality for a Node.js Express application
```

### Agent Confusion

```bash
# Be specific about scope
@developer Fix the bug
# Better:
@developer Fix the authentication bug where users can't login with valid credentials. Error occurs in login.js line 45.
```
