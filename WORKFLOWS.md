```bash
# BOS-AI runs validation before handoff
./integration-bridge/scripts/validation/validate-bundle.sh \
  "./output/proj_001/bundle-v1.0.0" \
  "./output/proj_001/validation-report.md"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Schema validation: 100% pass
- Content completeness: >95% score
- Cross-references: All resolved
- Business logic: No critical issues

##### Phase 2: Validation Gateway

**Step 2.1: Automated Validation**
```bash
# Integration bridge validates bundle
./integration-bridge/bridge validate \
  "./bos-ai/output/proj_001/bundle-v1.0.0"
```

**Validation Checks:**
1. **Schema Compliance**: YAML frontmatter structure
2. **Required Sections**: All mandatory content present
3. **Content Quality**: Minimum word counts, formatting
4. **Cross-References**: Internal links and dependencies
5. **Metadata Integrity**: Version consistency, checksums
6. **Business Logic**: Requirements feasibility and completeness

**Step 2.2: Validation Report Generation**
```yaml
# Example validation report structure
validation_status: "passed"
timestamp: "2025-01-29T10:00:00Z"
bundle_version: "1.0.0"
project_id: "proj_001"

results:
  schema_validation:
    status: "passed"
    errors: 0
    warnings: 2
  content_completeness:
    status: "passed"
    score: 97
    missing_sections: []
  cross_references:
    status: "passed"
    broken_links: 0
    total_links: 15

recommendations:
  - "Consider expanding market analysis section"
  - "Add more specific user acceptance criteria"
```

**Step 2.3: Human Review Gate (Optional)**

### 4. Clarification Request Workflow

Streamlined process for AGENT-11 to request clarifications without formal change requests.

#### Quick Clarification Process

**Step 1: Identify Unclear Requirements**
```bash
# AGENT-11 identifies ambiguous requirements
./integration-bridge/scripts/workflows/request-clarification.sh \
  --section "User Authentication" \
  --question "OAuth provider preference?" \
  --urgency "medium"
```

**Clarification Template:**
```markdown
# Clarification Request: OAuth Provider Selection

**Section**: User Authentication (PRD section 3.2)
**Question**: Which OAuth providers should be supported?
**Context**: PRD mentions "social login" but doesn't specify providers

## Current Requirement
"Users can log in using social media accounts"

## Clarification Needed
1. Which specific OAuth providers? (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
2. How many providers should be supported initially?
3. Any regional preferences or compliance requirements?

## Implementation Impact
- Google OAuth: 1 day implementation
- Multiple providers: 2-3 days implementation  
- Each provider requires separate API keys and testing

## Proposed Assumption
Implement Google OAuth initially, add others based on user feedback.

**Urgency**: Medium (needed within 2 days for development continuity)
**Timeline Impact**: None if answered within 48 hours
```

**Step 2: Automated Routing**
```bash
# Route clarification to appropriate BOS-AI module
./integration-bridge/scripts/workflows/route-clarification.sh \
  --request "CLAR-2025-001" \
  --category "technical_specification" \
  --urgency "medium"
```

**Step 3: BOS-AI Response**
```markdown
# Clarification Response: OAuth Provider Selection

**Request ID**: CLAR-2025-001
**Response Date**: 2025-01-29
**Responded By**: BOS-AI Strategy Module

## Answer
Support Google and GitHub OAuth initially.

**Rationale**:
- Google: Broadest user base coverage
- GitHub: Developer-friendly for technical users
- Facebook: Avoided due to privacy concerns in target market

## Additional Context
- Implement generic OAuth framework for easy addition of providers
- Plan to add Microsoft and Apple OAuth in v2.0
- User research showed 85% coverage with Google + GitHub

## Updated Requirement
Replace PRD section 3.2 with:
"Users can log in using Google or GitHub accounts via OAuth 2.0"

**Implementation Priority**: Google first, GitHub second
**Timeline**: No change to current estimates
```

#### FAQ Integration

**Step 1: FAQ Generation**
```bash
# Generate FAQ from frequent clarifications
./integration-bridge/scripts/workflows/generate-faq.sh \
  --project "proj_001" \
  --period "last_30_days"
```

**Common Clarifications FAQ:**
```markdown
# Project FAQ: Common Clarifications

## Authentication & Security

**Q: What OAuth providers should be supported?**
A: Google and GitHub for initial release. Generic framework for future additions.

**Q: What password strength requirements?**  
A: Minimum 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols. No maximum length limit.

**Q: Session timeout requirements?**
A: 24 hours for regular users, 4 hours for admin accounts.

## User Interface

**Q: Mobile responsiveness requirements?**
A: Full responsive design required. Mobile-first approach preferred.
