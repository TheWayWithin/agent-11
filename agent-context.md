# Agent Context Document

## Mission Overview
**Mission Code**: LIBRARY-ENHANCEMENT-2025-10-28
**Started**: 2025-10-28
**Current Phase**: Assessment Review & Planning
**Overall Status**: IN_PROGRESS

## Mission Objectives
Primary objectives from external assessment:
- [ ] Standardize agent definitions across all 14 library agents
- [ ] Consolidate redundant agents (content-creator → marketer, design-review → mission)
- [ ] Formalize tool permissions structure
- [ ] Evaluate structured state format options

**External Rating**: 85/100 overall suite design, 100/100 coordination
**Current Weaknesses**: Agent definition inconsistency (avg 65.4%), 3 weak agents (<50%)
**Estimated Time**: TBD (to be determined with strategist)
**Expected Impact**:
- Improved maintainability and scalability
- Reduced complexity (14 → 11 agents)
- Enhanced reliability through standardization
- Automated validation capabilities

## Critical Constraints
Important limitations and requirements to maintain:
- **Library vs Working Squad**: All changes target `project/agents/specialists/` (library agents), NOT `.claude/agents/` (working squad)
- **Deployment Model**: Changes affect what gets deployed to user projects via install.sh
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain existing mission compatibility
- **Security-First**: Never compromise security features in pursuit of convenience
- **Documentation Standards**: Library docs for general users, personal communication style only for Jamie
- **Tone Consistency**: Maintain military/tactical metaphors throughout

## Accumulated Findings

### External Assessment Summary
**Agent**: Manus AI (External Reviewer)
**Status**: Completed
**Key Decisions**:
- Overall suite design rated 85/100 (excellent concept, minor inconsistencies)
- Coordination & PM rated 100/100 (state-of-the-art)
- Individual agent average 65.4% (dragged down by 3 weak agents)
- Missions & Commands rated 90/100 (comprehensive coverage)

**Critical Information**:
- **11 Strong Agents**: coordinator, developer, architect, tester, strategist, designer, operator, documenter, support, analyst, marketer (all 75%+)
- **3 Weak Agents**: design-review (40%), agent-optimizer (30%), content-creator (25%)
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Agent definition structure varies significantly
- **Markdown Fragility**: Using MD for state management creates brittleness
- **Tool Permissions**: Current free-text format not robust enough

**Outputs Created**:
- Comprehensive 130-line assessment report
- Quantitative scoring for all agents
- Prioritized recommendations (4 levels)

## Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions
- **Centralized Coordination**: Single coordinator agent prevents chaotic multi-agent communication
- **Mission-Oriented Workflows**: Pre-defined missions provide structured, repeatable workflows
- **Dual-Document State**: project-plan.md (forward) + progress.md (backward) = complete tracking
- **Context Preservation**: agent-context.md + handoff-notes.md + evidence-repository.md prevent context loss

### Current Agent Structure
- **Library Agents** (deployed to users): 11 core + 3 experimental = 14 total
- **Working Squad** (internal dev): 15 agents for building AGENT-11 itself
- **Location**: `project/agents/specialists/*.md` (library)
- **Format**: Markdown with free-text structure (inconsistent)

### Implementation Patterns
- Agent definitions use military/tactical metaphors consistently
- Protocols include SCOPE BOUNDARIES, ANTI-PATTERNS, BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES
- Extended thinking guidance and self-verification protocols in mature agents
- Tool permissions defined in free-text format

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Active Issues
1. **Issue**: Agent definition inconsistency reduces reliability
   - **Impact**: Harder to maintain, extend, and parse programmatically
   - **Workaround**: Manual review and correction
   - **Owner**: To be delegated to strategist + architect

2. **Issue**: Redundant agents (content-creator, design-review, agent-optimizer)
   - **Impact**: Increases complexity without adding capability
   - **Workaround**: None currently
   - **Owner**: To be delegated to strategist

3. **Issue**: Tool permissions not formalized
   - **Impact**: No automated validation, risk of unauthorized actions
   - **Workaround**: Manual review
   - **Owner**: To be delegated to architect

### Resolved Issues
None yet

## Dependencies & Integrations

### External Dependencies
- Claude Code framework and tool ecosystem
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration system
- GitHub for version control and community

### Internal Dependencies
- Agent definitions depend on mission structure
- Missions depend on coordinator protocol
- install.sh deployment script depends on consistent agent structure

## Next Steps Queue
Priority-ordered tasks for upcoming phases:
1. **High Priority**: Review and prioritize Manus AI recommendations with strategist
2. **High Priority**: Design standardization approach for agent definitions (architect)
3. **Medium Priority**: Plan consolidation of redundant agents (strategist)
4. **Medium Priority**: Design tool permissions formalization (architect)
5. **Low Priority**: Evaluate structured state format options (long-term consideration)

## Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing missions | Medium | High | Thorough testing, backward compatibility checks |
| User confusion from agent consolidation | Low | Medium | Clear migration guide, changelog |
| Over-engineering standardization | Medium | Medium | Start simple, iterate based on feedback |
| Working squad vs library confusion | High | High | Clear documentation, path verification before changes |

## Performance Metrics
- Current library agents: 14
- Strong agents (75%+): 11
- Weak agents (<50%): 3
- Overall suite rating: 85/100
- Coordination rating: 100/100

## Handoff History
Record of all agent handoffs in this mission:
1. **From coordinator to pending specialists** (2025-10-28)
   - Handoff quality: Preparing
   - Context preserved: Initial mission setup in progress
