üßµ How we grew from 0 to $10k MRR in 90 days (as a solo founder):

1/ Started with a problem I had personally
Building projects was chaos. Needed simple tracking that didn't slow me down.

2/ Built an MVP in 2 weeks
- Next.js + Supabase
- 3 core features only
- Shipped with bugs (fixed later)

3/ Launched where developers hang out
- Hacker News: Show HN post
- Reddit: r/webdev, r/programming
- Twitter: Built in public from day 1

# LinkedIn Post

I spent 10 years managing complex projects with enterprise tools.

Then I became a solo founder and realized:
- Jira is overkill for small teams
- Trello is too simple for product work
- Notion becomes a mess at scale

So I built something different.

[Product] is project management that scales with you:
‚Üí Start solo, grow to a team
‚Üí Simple enough for MVPs
‚Üí Powerful enough for production
‚Üí AI that actually helps (not hypes)

We just crossed $10k MRR and 500 happy customers.

The lesson? Build for yourself first. Others probably need it too.

What project management pain points do you face?
