Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out, and I'm sorry you're experiencing issues with data export. I understand how urgent this is with your client meeting coming up.

**Immediate Solution:**
I can manually export your data for you right now. I'll send it to your email within 10 minutes.

**The Issue:**
We've identified a bug affecting export for accounts with 1000+ records. Our team is working on a fix.

**Timeline:**
- Immediate: Manual export (10 minutes)
- Fix deployment: Within 24 hours
- You'll receive an update once resolved

**Prevention:**
Once fixed, exports will work normally. We're also adding progress indicators for large exports.

Is there a specific format you need for your client meeting? I'm here to ensure you have everything you need.

Best regards,
The Support Team

P.S. As an apology for the inconvenience, I've added a credit to your account.
