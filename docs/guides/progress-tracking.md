# Mission Progress Tracking System

## Overview

AGENT-11 uses a **dual-file tracking system** designed to capture both your planned roadmap and actual implementation journey, including all the learning that happens along the way.

## The Two-File System

### project-plan.md - Forward-Looking Roadmap

**Purpose**: What we're PLANNING to do

**Contains**:
- Executive summary and objectives
- Technical architecture overview
- Task lists with checkboxes `[ ]` → `[x]`
- Milestone timeline and phases
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk assessment and mitigation

**Update When**:
- Mission start: Create with all planned tasks marked `[ ]`
- Phase start: Add phase-specific tasks before work begins
- Task completion: Mark `[x]` ONLY after specialist confirms done
- Progress review: Update to reflect actual vs planned progress

**Key Principle**: Keep current - the plan should reflect reality, not wishful thinking

---

### progress.md - Backward-Looking Changelog

**Purpose**: What we DID and what we LEARNED (especially from failures)

**Contains**:
- Deliverables created/updated with descriptions
- Changes made to code, configs, documentation
- **Complete issue history**: ALL attempted fixes (not just final solution)
- Root cause analysis for every problem
- Prevention strategies to avoid recurrence
- Patterns and lessons learned from failures

**Update When**:
- After each deliverable: Log what was created/changed with description
- When issue encountered: Create issue entry immediately with symptom and context
- After EACH fix attempt: Log attempt, rationale, result (✅ or ❌), and learning
- When issue resolved: Add root cause analysis and prevention strategy
- End of phase: Add lessons learned and patterns recognized

**Critical**: Document FAILED attempts, not just successes. Failed attempts teach us what doesn't work and why.

## Why This System Works

### Unlike Traditional Changelogs

**Traditional approach** (what MOST teams do):
```markdown
## 2025-10-15
- Fixed authentication bug
- Updated user profile API
```

**Problem**: No context, no learning, no patterns recognized.

---

**AGENT-11 approach** (what WE do):
```markdown
## 2025-10-15 - Authentication Token Expiry

**Issue**: Users being logged out after 60 minutes despite "remember me" checked

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ❌ Increased token expiry to 24 hours
   - Rationale: Simple config change
   - Result: Security team rejected (too long)
   - Learning: Always check security requirements first

2. ❌ Implemented sliding window refresh
   - Rationale: Industry standard pattern
   - Result: Race conditions in refresh logic
   - Learning: Concurrent requests need mutex

3. ✅ Used refresh token rotation with 7-day expiry
   - Rationale: Balances security and UX
   - Result: Works perfectly, security approved
   - Implementation: Added refresh endpoint with httpOnly cookie

**Root Cause**: Original implementation used access tokens only (no refresh tokens)

**Prevention**:
- Add auth architecture review to all new projects
- Include refresh token pattern in starter templates
- Document token lifecycle in CLAUDE.md
```

**Benefit**: Future authentication issues get solved in minutes (not hours) because we have a searchable knowledge base.

## Update Protocol

### For project-plan.md (The Plan)

1. **Mission Start**: Create with all planned tasks marked `[ ]`
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
   - [ ] Initialize repository
   - [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Configure environments
   ```

2. **Phase Start**: Add phase-specific tasks before work begins
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2-3)
   - [ ] Implement user authentication
   - [ ] Build dashboard UI
   - [ ] Add data export
   ```

3. **Task Completion**: Mark `[x]` ONLY after specialist confirms done
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
   - [x] Initialize repository (2025-10-15, @developer)
   - [x] Setup CI/CD pipeline (2025-10-16, @operator)
   - [ ] Configure environments (in progress)
   ```

4. **Keep Current**: Update to reflect actual vs planned progress
   - If tasks take longer than expected, update estimates
   - If new tasks discovered, add them immediately
   - If tasks no longer needed, remove and document why

---

### For progress.md (The Changelog)

1. **After Each Deliverable**: Log what was created/changed
   ```markdown
   ## 2025-10-15 - Repository Initialization

   **Deliverables**:
   - Created GitHub repository: acme-corp/task-manager
   - Added .gitignore for Node.js and IDE files
   - Initialized npm project with TypeScript
   - Setup ESLint and Prettier configurations

   **Key Decisions**:
   - Using TypeScript strict mode (better type safety)
   - Monorepo structure with Nx (future microservices)
   - Conventional Commits for changelog generation
   ```

2. **When Issue Encountered**: Create entry immediately
   ```markdown
   ## 2025-10-16 - CI/CD Pipeline Issues

   **Symptom**: GitHub Actions workflow failing on test step
   **Context**: Using Jest with TypeScript, tests pass locally
   **Environment**: Node 18, Ubuntu latest runner
   ```

3. **After EACH Fix Attempt**: Log attempt, result, learning
   ```markdown
   **Attempted Fixes**:

   1. ❌ Added ts-jest transformer
      - Rationale: TypeScript needs compilation
      - Result: Still failing with "Unexpected token 'export'"
      - Learning: ESM modules need different jest config

   2. ❌ Changed jest.config.js to use ESM
      - Rationale: Project uses ES modules
      - Result: New error "Cannot use import outside module"
      - Learning: Need both jest config AND package.json type:module

   3. ✅ Updated both configs + added NODE_OPTIONS
      - Rationale: Comprehensive ESM setup
      - Result: All tests passing in CI
      - Learning: ESM requires coordinated changes across config files
   ```

4. **When Issue Resolved**: Add root cause and prevention
   ```markdown
   **Root Cause**:
   Mismatch between local Node 20 (native ESM) and CI Node 18 (requires flags)

   **Prevention Strategy**:
   - Add .nvmrc file to lock Node version
   - Update CI to use .nvmrc
   - Add ESM config checklist to developer onboarding
   - Document ESM setup in CLAUDE.md
   ```

5. **End of Phase**: Add lessons and patterns
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 1 Lessons Learned

   **What Worked Well**:
   - TypeScript strict mode caught 12 bugs before runtime
   - Conventional Commits made changelog generation trivial
   - Nx workspace structure easy to understand

   **What Didn't Work**:
   - ESM configuration more complex than expected (2 hours debugging)
   - Monorepo tooling has learning curve (1 day ramp-up)

   **Patterns Recognized**:
   - Configuration issues: Always check version mismatches first
   - When local works but CI fails: Environment differences
   - ESM setup: All config files must agree (jest, ts, package.json)

   **For Next Phase**:
   - Budget extra time for configuration debugging
   - Document all non-obvious setups immediately
   - Test in CI early and often
   ```

## Benefits of Complete Issue History

### Traditional Approach (Final Solution Only)
```markdown
## 2025-10-16
- Fixed CI/CD pipeline configuration
```

**Time to solve similar issue in future**: 2-4 hours (start from scratch)

---

### AGENT-11 Approach (All Attempts Documented)
```markdown
## 2025-10-16 - CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**Issue**: Tests passing locally but failing in CI

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ❌ Added ts-jest (syntax errors)
2. ❌ ESM config in jest only (still errors)
3. ✅ Coordinated ESM setup across all configs

**Root Cause**: Node version mismatch (local 20, CI 18)
**Prevention**: .nvmrc + CI version lock
```

**Time to solve similar issue in future**: 15 minutes (search progress.md, apply pattern)

---

### Compound Learning Effect

After 3 months of missions:
- **Traditional changelog**: 50 lines, no patterns
- **AGENT-11progress.md**: 2,000 lines, 40+ reusable patterns

**Impact**:
- Authentication issues: 2 hours → 20 minutes
- Configuration problems: 3 hours → 30 minutes
- Performance optimization: 4 hours → 1 hour
- Integration debugging: 6 hours → 45 minutes

**ROI**: The time invested in detailed logging pays for itself after ~5 similar issues.

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

**Critical**: Updates to progress.md should flow into CLAUDE.md

**When to update CLAUDE.md**:
- Discovered project-specific pattern → Add to "Common Patterns" section
- Found security issue → Add to "Security Requirements" section
- Learned architecture constraint → Add to "Technical Constraints" section
- Identified performance bottleneck → Add to "Performance Guidelines" section

**Example Flow**:
```
1. Issue encountered: "Database queries slow on large datasets"
2. Fix attempts documented in progress.md (tried indexes, caching, pagination)
3. Root cause: N+1 query pattern in ORM
4. Prevention: Update CLAUDE.md with "Always use eager loading for relations"
5. Future: @developer reads CLAUDE.md before implementing similar feature
6. Result: Pattern never repeated
```

## Searchable Lessons Repository

## Templates

**Starting templates available**:
- [project-plan-template.md](/templates/project-plan-template.md) - Roadmap structure
- [progress-template.md](/templates/progress-template.md) - Changelog format

## Common Questions

### Q: How detailed should progress.md entries be?

**A**: Detailed enough that someone else (or future you) could understand:
- What problem you faced
- Why each solution seemed reasonable at the time
- Why it didn't work (if it failed)
- What you learned from the attempt

**Rule of thumb**: If it took more than 30 minutes to solve, document the journey.

---

### Q: Should I document successful first attempts?

**A**: Yes, but briefly. Focus on:
- What approach you used
- Why you chose it
- Any non-obvious implementation details

Even successful attempts teach patterns.

---

### Q: When do I archive old progress.md content?

**A**: When project reaches major milestones (every 2-4 weeks) OR when file exceeds 200 lines. Extract lessons to `/lessons/` repository and archive completed work to `/archive/`.

[→ See complete cleanup guide](lifecycle-management.md#cleanup-strategy)

---

### Q: What if an issue has 10+ fix attempts?

**A**: Document all of them! This is VALUABLE data:
- Shows complexity of the problem
- Prevents others from trying failed approaches
- Demonstrates thorough problem-solving
- Compound learning effect increases over time

The more attempts documented, the more valuable the entry.

---

### Q: How do I search progress.md for patterns?

**A**: Use grep or project search:

```bash
# Find all authentication issues
grep -A 20 "authentication" progress.md

# Find all N+1 query problems
grep -A 20 "N+1" progress.md

# Find all performance optimizations
grep -A 20 "performance" progress.md
```

Better: Extract to `/lessons/` repository organized by category.

---

## Summary

**The Power of Complete History**:
- Traditional changelogs: "What we did"
- AGENT-11 progress.md: "What we did, what we tried, what we learned, why it matters"

**Time Investment**: 5-10 minutes per issue to document thoroughly
**Time Saved**: 1-4 hours per similar future issue (10-40x ROI)

**Compound Effect**: Knowledge base grows more valuable over time, with patterns becoming instantly recognizable and solutions becoming copy-pasteable.
