## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Success indicators**: Critical for user confidence, should be in all steps
2. **Time estimates**: Set expectations, reduce anxiety
3. **Decision framework**: ✅/❌ format is instantly scannable
4. **Concrete examples**: Specifics (OAuth, Stripe) > generics ("build apps")
5. **Proof points first**: Metrics in WHY section validate claims early

### Improvements Applied
1. **Compression beyond target**: 173 lines vs target 250 (31% better)
2. **No generic claims**: Every example specific, every metric real
3. **Progressive structure**: WHAT → WHY → HOW natural flow
4. **Action-oriented**: Every section ends with next step or link

### For Phase 3 Application
1. Continue compression (aim for <1000 line final README)
2. Maintain success indicator pattern in workflows
3. Use time estimates for all missions
4. Keep concrete examples throughout (not generic descriptions)
5. Link to detailed guides, don't embed in README
