## Prerequisites (45 seconds)

### [00:30] Prerequisites Check
**[SCREEN: Terminal window, clear view]**

**Narration:**
"Before we start, you'll need three things. First, an Anthropic API account with Claude Code access. If you don't have this, pause here and sign up at anthropic.com."

**[SCREEN: Show version output]**

**Narration:**
"Second, verify Claude Code is installed by running `claude --version`. You should see version 0.1.0 or higher."

**[SCREEN: Show project directory with README.md, .git folder]**

**Narration:**
"Third, you'll need an active project directory. AGENT-11 installs locally to each project, not globally. This could be a Git repository, a Node project with package.json, or any directory with a README file. For this demo, I'm using a sample project called 'task-manager'."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]**
Required:
1. Anthropic API account
2. Claude Code installed
3. Project directory (Git, package.json, or README)

## Production Notes

### Visual Cues Reference
- **[SCREEN: ...]** = What should be visible on screen
- **[TYPE: ...]** = Text being typed into terminal
- **[HIGHLIGHT: ...]** = Specific element to emphasize (use arrow, circle, or zoom)
- **[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** = Graphics overlay with key points
- **[PRESS: Enter]** = Keyboard action to show

### Timing Markers
- All timestamps are cumulative from video start
- Segments can be slightly adjusted but total should stay within 5 minutes
- Allow 2-3 seconds for visual transitions between sections

### Tone Guidelines
- **Friendly**: Use conversational language, avoid jargon
- **Encouraging**: Emphasize how easy the process is
- **Clear**: Speak slowly enough to follow along
- **Confident**: Reassure viewers this will work

### Accessibility
- Narration should describe all visual elements for screen reader users
- On-screen text should reinforce narration (redundancy is good)
- Terminal output should be large enough to read at 720p
- Use high contrast colors for highlights

### Common Issues Callout
Consider adding a 10-second segment at [04:00] if timing allows:

**"If agents don't appear after installation, restart Claude Code completely using `/exit` then `claude`. This refreshes the agent registry."**
