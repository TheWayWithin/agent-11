## Visual Diagram Evidence

### Diagram 1: System Architecture Overview
**Type**: Mermaid graph TB (top-bottom flowchart)
**Lines**: 861-947 (87 lines)
**Purpose**: Show complete 3-layer AGENT-11 architecture

**Components Visualized**:
- User Layer: Developer/Founder entry point
- Mission Layer: /coord command, 20 pre-built missions, custom workflows
- Coordination Layer: Coordinator agent + context files (project-plan, agent-context, handoff-notes, progress)
- Specialist Layer: All 11 agents (Strategist, Architect, Developer, Tester, Operator, Designer, Documenter, Support, Analyst, Marketer)
- Tool Layer: Read/Write/Edit, Bash/Git, MCP integrations, Memory API

**Visual Design**: Color-coded by layer (blue, orange, purple, green, yellow)
**Data Flow**: User → Missions → Coordinator → Specialists → Tools

---

### Diagram 2: Agent Collaboration Flow
**Type**: Mermaid sequenceDiagram
**Lines**: 963-1012 (50 lines)
**Purpose**: Show zero-context-loss agent handoff protocol

**Workflow Visualized**:
- Phase 1: Strategist analyzes requirements (30-45 min)
- Phase 2: Architect designs solution (30-45 min)
- Phase 3: Developer implements code (2-4 hours)
- Phase 4: Tester validates quality (1 hour)

**Context Interactions**:
- Each agent reads from agent-context.md (cumulative knowledge)
- Each agent reads from handoff-notes.md (previous agent's findings)
- Each agent writes findings back to both files
- Result: 100% knowledge preservation

---

### Diagram 3: Context Management System
**Type**: Mermaid flowchart TD (data flow)
**Lines**: 1025-1083 (59 lines)
**Purpose**: Show knowledge preservation architecture

**Files Documented**:
- **agent-context.md**: Mission objectives, cumulative findings, technical decisions, known issues, dependencies
- **handoff-notes.md**: Immediate task, critical context, warnings/blockers, specific instructions, test results
- **evidence-repository.md**: Screenshots, code snippets, test results, API responses, error logs
- **/memories/**: Persistent storage (project/, technical/, lessons/)

**Agent Workflow**:
1. Agent reads context (agent-context + handoff-notes + memories)
2. Agent performs work
3. Agent updates context (writes findings to all relevant files)

**Output**: project-plan.md, progress.md, code/tests/docs

---

### Diagram 4: Mission Execution Lifecycle
**Type**: Mermaid stateDiagram-v2 (state machine)
**Lines**: 1102-1163 (62 lines)
**Purpose**: Show complete mission workflow with time estimates

**Phases Visualized**:
1. **Planning** (5-10 min) - Coordinator reads mission, creates plan
2. **Analysis** (30-45 min) - Requirements analysis, user stories
3. **Design** (30-45 min) - System design, tech selection
4. **Implementation** (2-4 hours) - Code + unit tests
5. **Testing** (1 hour) - E2E tests, quality validation
6. **Verification** (15 min) - Self-verification, deliverables confirmation

**Error Recovery**:
- Tests fail → return to Implementation
- Bugs found → iterate Implementation
- All verified → Mission complete

**Total Time**: 4-8 hours for standard feature development

## Quality Benchmarks

### What Makes This World-Class (from assessment)
1. **User-Centric Design**: Inline troubleshooting, recovery protocols, getting unstuck
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: What → Why → How → Do pattern
3. **Action-Oriented**: Clear next steps, copy-pastable commands, verification
4. **Transparency**: Cost estimates, time estimates, known limitations
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Installation to deployment, beginner to advanced
6. **Innovation**: Command reference, real examples, recovery protocols

### Standards to Maintain
- Inline troubleshooting in all new content
- Expected output for verification steps
- Recovery protocols for workflows
- Time and cost estimates upfront
- Real, copy-pastable examples
- Inline comments explaining what to write
