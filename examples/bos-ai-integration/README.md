# BOS-AI Integration Example: TaskFlow

This directory contains a **realistic example** of BOS-AI output that demonstrates proper integration with AGENT-11. Use this as a reference when preparing your own BOS-AI strategy documents for AGENT-11 execution.

## What This Example Demonstrates

**Project**: TaskFlow - A simple task management SaaS for solopreneurs
**Purpose**: Show what a complete BOS-AI PRD bundle looks like
**Use Case**: Learn the expected format and structure before your first integration

## Directory Structure

```
examples/bos-ai-integration/
├── README.md                  # This file
└── ideation/
    ├── PRD.md                 # Main product requirements document
    ├── context.md             # Business context and market analysis
    ├── brand-guidelines.md    # Brand identity and voice
    └── vision.md              # Long-term product vision
```

## How to Use This Example

### Option 1: Quick Test Run

Test AGENT-11's workflow with this example project:

```bash
# Navigate to a temporary workspace
cd ~/Desktop && mkdir taskflow-test && cd taskflow-test

# Copy the example ideation files
cp -r /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/examples/bos-ai-integration/ideation ./

# Initialize AGENT-11 with the example
/coord dev-setup ideation/PRD.md

# Start development
/coord build ideation/PRD.md
```

This demonstration will:
- Analyze the PRD and supporting documents
- Create `project-plan.md` with strategic roadmap
- Create `progress.md` for tracking deliverables
- Create `architecture.md` with technical design
- Begin implementation based on requirements

### Option 2: Use as Template

Adapt this structure for your own project:

```bash
# Create your project directory
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
mkdir ideation

# Copy TaskFlow files as templates
cp /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/examples/bos-ai-integration/ideation/PRD.md ideation/PRD.md

# Edit the files with your product details
# Initialize AGENT-11
/coord dev-setup ideation/PRD.md
```

### Option 3: Learn the Format

Review these files to understand BOS-AI → AGENT-11 document expectations:

1. **PRD.md** - Feature structure, user stories, and acceptance criteria format
2. **context.md** - Market analysis and user pain point documentation
3. **brand-guidelines.md** - Brand identity and design guidance
4. **vision.md** - Long-term goals and MVP scope prioritization

## What Makes This Example Realistic?

### Complete Product Definition
- **Target Market**: Solopreneurs managing 3-10 projects simultaneously
- **Core Problem**: Existing tools are too complex or too simple
- **Solution**: Focused task management with smart prioritization

### Proper Structure for AGENT-11
- ✅ Clear user stories in INVEST format
- ✅ Specific acceptance criteria (testable and measurable)
- ✅ Success metrics defined upfront
- ✅ Technical constraints identified
- ✅ MVP scope clearly separated from future features

### Real-World Considerations
- Market research and competitive analysis
- User personas based on actual solopreneur pain points
- Brand guidelines that inform UI/UX decisions
- Vision document that explains strategic priorities

## Key Learnings from This Example

### 1. Document Relationships

**PRD.md** (The What):
- Features and requirements
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics

**context.md** (The Why):
- Market opportunity
- User pain points
- Competitive landscape

**brand-guidelines.md** (The How - Style):
- Visual identity
- Tone of voice
- Design principles

**vision.md** (The Future):
- Long-term goals
- Strategic priorities
- Growth roadmap

### 2. What AGENT-11 Expects

**Minimum Required**:
- At least one file in `ideation/` with product requirements
- Clear feature descriptions or user stories
- Some indication of success criteria

**Recommended for Best Results**:
- PRD.md with complete requirements
- Supporting documents for context
- Clear separation of MVP vs future features
- Testable acceptance criteria

**Optional but Helpful**:
- Brand guidelines (informs design decisions)
- Vision document (guides prioritization)
- Market analysis (validates assumptions)

### 3. Format Guidelines

**Markdown Structure**:
```markdown
## Section Headers (H2)
### Subsections (H3)
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold** for emphasis
- Clear numbering for sequential steps
```

**User Story Format**:
```markdown
### Story: [Brief Title]

**As a** [user type]
**I want to** [action]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 1
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 2
- [ ] Edge case handling
```

**Technical Requirements**:
```markdown
### Technical Constraints
- Constraint 1 with rationale
- Constraint 2 with alternatives considered
- Performance requirement with metric
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need all four files?
**A**: No. AGENT-11 works with just `PRD.md`. Additional files provide richer context but aren't required.

### Q: Can I use different file names?
**A**: Yes. AGENT-11 reads all files in `ideation/` directory. Names are for your organization.

### Q: What if my BOS-AI output looks different?
**A**: That's fine. AGENT-11 is flexible. As long as requirements are clear, format variations are acceptable.

### Q: Can I add more files?
**A**: Yes. Add market research, user interviews, technical specs - AGENT-11 uses all available context.

### Q: What about images or diagrams?
**A**: Currently, AGENT-11 works best with Markdown text. Reference images by filename, but include text descriptions.
