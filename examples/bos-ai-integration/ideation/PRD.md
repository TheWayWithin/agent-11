# Product Requirements Document: TaskFlow

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: Ready for Development
**Product Owner**: BOS-AI Strategic Analysis Team

---

## Executive Summary

TaskFlow is a focused task management SaaS designed specifically for solopreneurs managing 3-10 concurrent projects. Unlike general-purpose tools that overwhelm with features or simple to-do apps that lack structure, TaskFlow provides intelligent prioritization, deadline tracking, and project organization optimized for one-person operations.

**Target Launch**: 8-week MVP development cycle
**Target Market**: 50,000+ solopreneurs in SaaS, consulting, and creative industries
**Business Model**: Freemium with $12/month Pro tier

---

## Problem Statement

### User Pain Points

**Solopreneurs face three critical challenges**:

1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Managing multiple client projects requires constant mental context switching, leading to lost productivity and missed deadlines

2. **Over-Engineering by Existing Tools**: Enterprise tools (Asana, Jira, Monday.com) are built for teams and overwhelm solo users with collaboration features they don't need

3. **Under-Engineering by Simple Apps**: Basic to-do apps (Apple Reminders, Google Tasks) lack project structure and prioritization intelligence needed for professional work

### Market Opportunity

- **Total Addressable Market**: 60 million solopreneurs globally (2025)
- **Serviceable Market**: 8 million knowledge workers managing multiple projects
- **Initial Target**: 50,000 tech-savvy solopreneurs in US/EU
- **Willingness to Pay**: $10-15/month for productivity tools (validated by surveys)

**Success Criteria**:
- 70% of users complete onboarding
- Average time: < 3 minutes
- 50% add tasks beyond the 3 guided tasks

#### Daily Usage Flow (Returning User)

2. Land on "Today" view (default screen)
3. See 5-10 prioritized tasks
4. Click task to see details or mark complete
5. Add new tasks as needed (quick-add button always visible)

**Success Criteria**:

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: Prioritization Algorithm Effectiveness**
- **Impact**: If algorithm isn't helpful, users won't see value
- **Mitigation**: A/B test algorithm, allow manual override, gather user feedback weekly
- **Fallback**: Simplify to deadline-only sorting if ML approach fails

**Risk 2: User Acquisition**
- **Impact**: Product is great but no one finds it
- **Mitigation**: Pre-launch: build email waitlist (target 500), launch on Product Hunt, post in solopreneur communities
- **Fallback**: Extend free tier indefinitely if needed to grow user base

**Risk 3: Retention**
- **Impact**: Users sign up but don't stick (common in productivity tools)
- **Mitigation**: Onboarding flow, email engagement series, weekly usage reports
- **Fallback**: Add habit-forming features (streaks, achievements) if retention < 30%

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk 4: Technical Performance**
- **Impact**: Slow app kills productivity tool credibility
- **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring from Day 1, aggressive optimization
- **Fallback**: Upgrade Supabase tier if database becomes bottleneck

**Risk 5: Scope Creep**
- **Impact**: MVP takes 16 weeks instead of 8
- **Mitigation**: Ruthless feature prioritization, weekly scope reviews
- **Fallback**: Launch with fewer features if timeline slips (core features only)

## Open Questions

**Questions for Development Team**:

1. Should we build a PWA (Progressive Web App) for mobile instead of waiting for native apps?
   - **Tradeoff**: PWA is faster to build but less capable than native
   - **Recommendation**: Yes for MVP, native apps in V2

2. What's the maximum task/project count we should support on free tier before performance degrades?
   - **Need**: Load testing to determine realistic limits
   - **Initial Guess**: 200 tasks, 20 projects (to be validated)

3. Should email reminders be real-time or batched (e.g., sent at 9am daily)?
   - **Tradeoff**: Real-time is more accurate, batched is more cost-effective
   - **Recommendation**: Batched for MVP (9am user's local time)

4. Do we need offline support for MVP?
   - **Tradeoff**: Offline adds complexity but useful for mobile users
   - **Recommendation**: No for MVP, add in V2 if users request

**Upcoming View**: A 7-day forecast of tasks with approaching deadlines

**Smart Prioritization**: Algorithm that orders tasks based on deadline, priority flag, and project importance

**Solopreneur**: An entrepreneur who runs their business alone, without employees or co-founders
