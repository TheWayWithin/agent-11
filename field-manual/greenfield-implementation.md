## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: MVP-First Approach (Recommended)

Build a minimum viable product quickly, then iterate:

**Phase 1: Project Initialization (Day 1)**
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Initialize git repository
git init
git branch -m main

# Create basic project structure
mkdir -p src tests docs

# Initialize package management
npm init -y  # or equivalent for your stack

# Deploy AGENT-11 immediately
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s core
```

**Phase 2: Foundation Setup (Days 1-3)**
```bash
# Start with strategy and architecture
@strategist "Define the MVP scope and user stories for this new project"

@architect "Design the technical architecture for our MVP, focusing on simplicity and scalability"

# Set up development environment
@developer "Set up the basic project structure, build system, and development environment"

@operator "Configure initial CI/CD pipeline and development deployment"
```
