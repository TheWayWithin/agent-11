# MCP Integration Guide for AGENT-11 üîå

## What are MCPs?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are specialized tools available in Claude Code that provide direct integration with external services and enhanced capabilities. They appear as tools prefixed with `mcp__` and enable agents to perform complex tasks efficiently without writing custom code.

## Discovery Protocol

### Finding Available MCPs
```bash
# Primary discovery method
grep "mcp__"

# Look for tools starting with mcp__ prefix
# Common pattern: mcp__[service]__[action]
```

### MCP Assessment Checklist
1. ‚úÖ Check for MCPs at mission start
2. ‚úÖ Map MCPs to planned tasks
3. ‚úÖ Document available MCPs in project-plan.md
4. ‚úÖ Track MCP usage throughout project
5. ‚úÖ Update CLAUDE.md with discovered patterns

```

## Agent-Specific MCP Usage

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer
**Primary MCPs**: Context7, Supabase, GitHub, Firecrawl

```markdown
Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Check mcp__supabase for database tasks
- [ ] Use mcp__context7 for library docs
- [ ] Use mcp__github for version control
- [ ] Use mcp__firecrawl for API research
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architect
**Primary MCPs**: Context7, Firecrawl

```markdown
Research Protocol:
1. Use mcp__context7 for framework documentation
2. Use mcp__firecrawl for pattern analysis
3. Research competitors with mcp__firecrawl
4. Document MCP-sourced decisions
```

### üß™ Tester
**Primary MCPs**: Playwright, Context7

```markdown
Testing Automation:
1. Always check for mcp__playwright first
2. Generate tests from user stories
3. Use mcp__context7 for test framework docs
4. Fall back to manual only if unavailable
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operator
**Primary MCPs**: Supabase, Netlify, Railway

```markdown
Infrastructure Setup:
- Database: mcp__supabase
- Frontend: mcp__netlify
- Backend: mcp__railway
- Monitoring: Check for specific MCPs
```

### üéØ Coordinator
**Assessment Responsibility**: Check all MCPs

```markdown
MCP Delegation:
1. grep "mcp__" at mission start
2. Map MCPs to specialists
3. Include MCPs in task context
4. Track usage in project-plan.md
```

## Best Practices

### MCP-First Development
1. **Always check first**: Before manual implementation
2. **Document usage**: Track in project-plan.md
3. **Share discoveries**: Update CLAUDE.md
4. **Fallback ready**: Have manual approach as backup

### Common Patterns

#### Database Operations
```bash
# Instead of: Writing custom Supabase client
# Use: mcp__supabase for all operations
```

#### Documentation Research
```bash
# Instead of: Googling for docs
# Use: mcp__context7__get-library-docs
```

#### Web Scraping
```bash
# Instead of: Writing scraping scripts
# Use: mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape
```

#### Testing Automation
```bash
# Instead of: Manual Playwright setup
# Use: mcp__playwright browser commands
```

## MCP Discovery Mission

When starting a new project:

```markdown
## MCP Discovery Checklist
- [ ] Run grep "mcp__" to find all MCPs
- [ ] Document in project-plan.md
- [ ] Map MCPs to team specialists
- [ ] Create MCP usage guidelines
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with patterns
```

## Fallback Strategies

When MCPs are unavailable:

1. **Document absence**: Note in project-plan.md
2. **Manual implementation**: Use traditional approach
3. **Request addition**: Suggest MCP installation
4. **Track workarounds**: Document for future

## Performance Benefits

Using MCPs provides:
- ‚ö° **Speed**: Pre-built integrations
- üéØ **Accuracy**: Tested implementations
- üìö **Documentation**: Always up-to-date
- üîÑ **Consistency**: Standardized approaches
- üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**: Maintained by providers

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Not Available
- Check spelling: `mcp__` prefix required
- Verify installation in project
- Check Claude Code MCP settings
- Fall back to manual approach

### MCP Errors
- Check parameters and format
- Verify service credentials
- Review MCP documentation
- Report to @coordinator

## Future MCPs to Watch

Keep an eye out for:
- Analytics MCPs (tracking, metrics)
- Email service MCPs (SendGrid, Resend)
- Payment MCPs (Stripe expansion)
- Monitoring MCPs (Sentry, DataDog)
- AI service MCPs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
