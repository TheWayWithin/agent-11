# Mission: Dev-Setup ðŸš€
## Greenfield Project Initialization

### Mission Type
**Initial Setup** - Foundation laying for new projects

### Estimated Duration
30-45 minutes

### Required Assets
- Ideation document (PRD, brand guidelines, architecture specs, vision doc)
- GitHub repository name/URL
- Project vision and goals

---

## Mission Briefing

This mission establishes the foundation for a new greenfield project by:
1. Setting up GitHub integration
2. Analyzing ideation documents
3. Creating initial project plan
4. Establishing progress tracking
5. Configuring CLAUDE.md for ongoing development

### Prerequisites
- AGENT-11 deployed to project
- Ideation document prepared
- GitHub repository created (or ready to create)

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: MCP Discovery (2 min)
```bash
/coord "Checking available MCPs for project setup..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator runs grep "mcp__" to identify available tools
- Documents available MCPs in project-plan.md
- Maps MCPs to project needs:
  - Database: mcp__supabase
  - Documentation: mcp__context7
  - Testing: mcp__playwright
  - Deployment: mcp__netlify, mcp__railway
- Notes which agents should use which MCPs

### Phase 1: Memory Bootstrap from Ideation (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Bootstrap greenfield project memory from ideation.md"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator reads ideation document(s)
- Creates `/memories` directory structure:
  - `/memories/project/` (requirements, architecture, constraints, metrics)
  - `/memories/user/` (preferences, context, goals)
  - `/memories/technical/` (decisions, patterns, tooling)
  - `/memories/lessons/` (insights, debugging, optimizations)
- Extracts to memory files using `/project/field-manual/bootstrap-guide.md`:
  - `/memories/project/requirements.xml` - Core features, user stories
  - `/memories/project/constraints.xml` - Security, performance, business limits
  - `/memories/project/architecture.xml` - Tech stack, architectural decisions
  - `/memories/user/preferences.xml` - Communication style, technical depth
  - `/memories/user/context.xml` - User background, goals, pain points
- **Security validation**: Path validation, content sanitization, size limits
- **Quality checks**: XML validation, gap identification, duplicate detection
- Reports bootstrap results and any missing information

**Reference**: See `/project/field-manual/bootstrap-guide.md` for full bootstrap protocol

### Phase 2: GitHub Setup (5 min)
```bash
/coord "Setting up GitHub integration..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator prompts for GitHub details
- Initializes git if needed
- Sets up remote origin
- Creates initial commit structure

### Phase 3: CLAUDE.md Generation (5 min)
```bash
/coord "Generating project-specific CLAUDE.md from memory..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator generates CLAUDE.md using `/templates/claude-template.md`
- Populates from memory files:
  - Project overview from requirements.xml
  - Architecture from architecture.xml
  - Constraints from constraints.xml
  - Development guidelines from preferences.xml
- Adds MCP configuration discovered in Phase 0
- Includes memory protocol and tracking requirements
- Validates completeness and accuracy

**Reference**: See `/templates/claude-template.md` for template structure

### Phase 4: Architecture Documentation (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating architecture documentation from memory..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @architect creates `architecture.md` using `/templates/architecture.md`
- Populates from `/memories/project/architecture.xml`:
  - System overview and boundaries
  - Infrastructure architecture (from memory)
  - Application architecture (from memory)
  - Data architecture (from memory)
  - Integration points
  - Architecture decisions (from memory/technical/decisions.xml)
  - Current limitations
  - Next steps
- Ensures alignment with memory and CLAUDE.md

**Reference**: See `/project/field-manual/architecture-sop.md` for comprehensive guidelines

### Phase 5: Project Planning (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating project plan from memory and architecture..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist creates `project-plan.md` from memory:
  - Executive summary (from requirements.xml vision)
  - Core objectives (from requirements.xml features)
  - Technical architecture (referencing architecture.md and memory)
  - Milestone roadmap (from requirements and constraints)
  - Success metrics (from memories/project/success_metrics.xml)
  - Risk assessment
  - Resource requirements (from constraints.xml)
- Ensures alignment with memory and CLAUDE.md

**project-plan.md Structure:**
```markdown
