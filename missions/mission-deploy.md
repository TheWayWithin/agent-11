# Mission: DEPLOY ðŸš€
## Production Deployment Preparation and Execution

**Mission Code**: DEPLOY  
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Squad Required**: Operator, Tester, Developer

## Mission Briefing

Execute a safe, systematic production deployment with proper validation, monitoring, and rollback procedures. This mission ensures your code reaches users reliably with minimal risk.

## Required Inputs

1. **Tested Codebase** (required) - Code that has passed all tests
2. **Deployment Configuration** (optional) - Environment configs, secrets
3. **Release Notes** (optional) - User-facing change documentation

## Mission Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (15-20 minutes)
**Lead**: @tester
**Support**: @operator
**Objective**: Ensure deployment readiness through comprehensive validation

**@tester Actions**:
1. **Execute Complete Test Suite** (Bash)
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test                    # Unit + integration tests
   npx playwright test         # E2E tests
   npm run test:coverage       # Check coverage
   ```
   - Verify 100% test pass rate
   - Confirm coverage meets standards (>80% critical paths)
   - Check for flaky tests (rerun to confirm stability)

2. **Validate Build Process** (Bash)
   ```bash
   npm run build              # Production build
   npm run lint               # Code quality checks
   npm run type-check         # TypeScript validation
   ```
   - Confirm build completes without errors
   - Check bundle sizes are within limits
   - Validate no console warnings or errors

   # Wait for deployment completion
   # Monitor deployment logs for errors
   ```
   - Verify deployment completes successfully
   - Check all services start correctly
   - Validate deployment version matches expected

2. **Initial Health Checks**
   - âœ… Application responds to health check endpoint
   - âœ… Database connection established
   - âœ… External services reachable
   - âœ… Background jobs running

**@tester Actions** (Validation):
3. **Smoke Test Execution** (Bash + mcp__playwright)
   ```bash
   # Run smoke tests against staging
   ENVIRONMENT=staging npx playwright test tests/smoke/
   ```
   - **Critical User Flows**:
     - âœ… Homepage loads successfully
     - âœ… User login works correctly

- **Coordinates with**: Team communication systems
- **Requires**: CI/CD pipeline and monitoring setup
