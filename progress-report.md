- Corrected timeline accuracy ("3 weeks" ‚Üí "under 1 day")
- Strategic message: "If AGENT-11 can build itself, it can build anything"

### 4. Error Recovery & Guardrails (October 18, 2025)
**Type**: Quality Assurance & Architecture Documentation
**Files**: `.claude/claude.md` (new), 3 library agents optimized, handoff-notes.md

**Error Discovered**: Template extraction performed on wrong agent directory
- **Wrong Target**: `.claude/agents/` (working squad for internal use)
- **Correct Target**: `project/agents/specialists/` (library agents deployed to users)
- **Root Cause**: Missing architectural documentation

**Recovery Actions**:
1. **Created `.claude/claude.md`** (200+ lines) - Project guardrails
   - Working Squad vs Library Agents distinction
   - 99% vs 1% rule (library agents vs internal tools)
   - Verification protocol before agent modifications
   - Common scenarios with correct target routing
   - File structure reference and quick reference table

2. **Applied Optimization to Correct Targets**:
   - `documenter.md`: 994‚Üí519 lines (-475, 48% reduction)
   - `marketer.md`: 730‚Üí428 lines (-302, 41% reduction)
   - `support.md`: 698‚Üí420 lines (-278, 40% reduction)
   - Total: 1,055 lines removed from library agents

**Final Status**:
- ‚úÖ Working Squad optimized (inadvertent bonus)
- ‚úÖ Library Agents optimized (intended target)
- ‚úÖ Templates centralized (7 files, reused by both)
- ‚úÖ Guardrails prevent future errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Template Extraction Target Error
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Severity**: Medium (corrected before user impact)

**Problem**: Template extraction optimization performed on `.claude/agents/` (working squad) instead of `project/agents/specialists/` (library agents)

**Root Cause**: Missing architectural documentation distinguishing working squad from library agents

**Resolution**:
1. Created `.claude/claude.md` with comprehensive guardrails
2. Applied optimization to correct targets (library agents)
3. Both agent sets ended up optimized (bonus benefit)
4. Zero user impact (library agents not yet deployed)

**Prevention**: Verification protocol now requires checking target directory before significant work

**Learning**: Document project-specific architectural distinctions in `.claude/claude.md` to prevent future confusion

### Issue 2: Command Discovery Gap
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Severity**: High (user experience issue)

**Problem**: Only `/coord` command documented in README - other 5 commands hidden

**Root Cause**: Commands added over time without updating comprehensive documentation

**Resolution**:
1. Created comprehensive Command Reference section (155 lines)
2. Documented all 6 commands with syntax, examples, use cases
3. Added comparison table for command selection guidance
4. Included real-world examples (JWT auth, feature build, security audit)

**Prevention**: Add command documentation requirement to slash command creation checklist

**Learning**: Hidden features are useless features - make everything discoverable

### Issue 3: Dogfooding Timeline Inaccuracy
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Severity**: Medium (credibility issue)

**Problem**: README stated "AGENT-11 built in 3 weeks" when actual time was "under 1 day"

**Root Cause**: Initial estimate vs actual delivery not corrected in documentation

**Resolution**:
1. Corrected timeline to "under 1 day" throughout README
2. Elevated dogfooding as primary proof point
3. Removed verbose project details (moved to dedicated file)
4. Strategic message: "If AGENT-11 can build itself, it can build anything"

**Prevention**: Regular documentation accuracy audits

**Learning**: Accuracy matters for credibility - correct timelines improve trust
