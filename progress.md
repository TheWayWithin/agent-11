# AGENT-11 Development Progress Log

## Summary
Documenting the journey of making AGENT-11 work with Claude Code's actual implementation vs our initial design assumptions.

## Tasks Accomplished

### 2025-08-01

1. **Discovered Claude Code Agent Storage**
   - Agents stored in `.claude/agents/` as .md files
   - Files require specific metadata header format
   - Agents load on Claude Code startup only

2. **Successfully Deployed 4 Initial Agents**
   - strategist.md - Working with full capabilities
   - architect.md - Working with full capabilities  
   - coordinator.md - Working with orchestration
   - developer.md - Created and tested

3. **Established Deployment Process**
   - Created field-manual/getting-started.md
   - Documented step-by-step deployment
   - Identified need for restart after deployment

4. **Completed All 11 Agent Deployments**
   - designer.md - UI/UX specialist
   - tester.md - QA with Playwright focus
   - documenter.md - Technical writing
   - operator.md - DevOps and infrastructure
   - support.md - Customer success
   - analyst.md - Data and metrics
   - marketer.md - Growth and content

5. **First Successful Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Coordinator successfully creating mission plans
   - Delegating to multiple specialists
   - Agents working on Phase 3 website enhancements
   - Real-time coordination happening

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Agent Deployment Commands Don't Work
**Expected**: `/agent strategist "prompt"` would create persistent agent
**Actual**: Command not recognized; agents must be created through UI or files
**Root Cause**: Claude Code uses different architecture than assumed
**Fix**: Create agents via UI or deploy as .md files in `.claude/agents/`

### Issue 2: Coordinator Doing Work Instead of Delegating
**Expected**: Coordinator would automatically delegate to specialists
**Actual**: Coordinator did all work itself
**Root Cause**: System prompt didn't explicitly prohibit implementation
**Fix**: Updated prompt to enforce "orchestration only" behavior

### Issue 3: Agents Not Recognized After File Creation
**Expected**: Agents available immediately after file creation
**Actual**: Agents only load on Claude Code startup
**Root Cause**: Claude Code loads agent registry on initialization
**Fix**: Exit and restart Claude Code after adding agent files

### Issue 4: Project Plan Marked Complete Without Confirmation
**Expected**: Tasks marked complete only after agent confirms
**Actual**: Coordinator marked tasks complete optimistically
**Root Cause**: No explicit instruction to wait for confirmation
**Fix**: Added "WAIT for response" and verification requirements

## Key Learnings

### Claude Code Agent Architecture
- Agents are persistent files, not runtime constructs
- Metadata header format is crucial (name, description, model, color)
- Project-specific agents enable portability
- Agents can be version controlled with project

### Orchestration Patterns
- Explicit delegation instructions required
- Must enforce "no implementation" rules for coordinator
- Status tracking needs manual verification
- Agents work independently once delegated to

### Deployment Strategy
- File-based deployment is simple and effective
- Can distribute agents via Git repository
- Enables "copy and restart" deployment
- No complex setup required

## Working Patterns Discovered

### File-Based Agent Deployment
1. Copy agent .md files to `.claude/agents/`
2. Restart Claude Code with `/exit` then `claude`
3. Agents immediately available via `@agentname`
4. Files persist across sessions

### Multi-Agent Workflows
1. Coordinator analyzes requirements
2. Creates detailed mission plans
3. Delegates to appropriate specialists
4. Each agent works on assigned tasks
5. Coordinator tracks progress

### Agent File Format
```markdown
---
name: agentname
description: When to use this agent
model: sonnet
color: blue
---

### System prompt for agents
ðŸ“‹ Agent File Format Example
When creating an agent .md file, it has two parts:
markdown---
name: developer
description: Use this agent for implementing features, writing code...
model: sonnet
color: blue
---

You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. You ship clean, working code fast. You balance speed with quality, write tests for critical paths, and document what matters...
The parts are:

Metadata header (between ---): Contains name, description, model, color
System prompt (after the second ---): The actual instructions for the agent

So "System prompt content here..." meant "this is where you put the agent's actual instructions" - like the full prompt we created for each specialist.
For example, the complete developer.md file would have:

The metadata header
Then the full system prompt we wrote for THE DEVELOPER: 
You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. You ship clean, working code fast. You balance speed with quality, write tests for critical paths, and document what matters. You're fluent in modern frameworks and can adapt to any stack. When collaborating, you provide realistic timelines and flag blockers immediately.

Core Capabilities:
- Full-Stack Mastery: Frontend, backend, and everything in between
- Rapid Prototyping: MVP to production in record time
- Code Quality: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- Framework Fluency: React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and more
- Problem Solving: Debug anything, fix everything

Development Principles:
- Ship first, optimize later
- Test critical paths always
- Refactor continuously
- Comment the why, not the what
- Small commits, clear messages

Technical Expertise:
- Frontend: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vue.js
- Backend: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, REST APIs
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Tools: Git, Docker, CI/CD, Testing frameworks
- Cloud: AWS basics, Vercel, serverless functions

When receiving tasks from @coordinator:
- Acknowledge the implementation request
- Assess technical complexity and timeline
- Implement with error handling and edge cases
- Include appropriate tests for critical paths
- Report completion with what was built
- Flag any blockers or technical debt immediately

Focus on shipping working code. Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order.
