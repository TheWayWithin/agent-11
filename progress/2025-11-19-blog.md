# When Docs Lie: Squashing a Sneaky Persistence Bug – Day 42 of AGENT-11

> **TL;DR:** Turns out, writing down that a fix is done doesn’t mean it actually is — today I hunted down a ghost bug caused by a documentation-only “fix” and finally banished it for real.

## 🎯 Today's Focus

I spent the day unraveling a frustrating mystery: a critical file persistence bug that was supposed to be fixed months ago but kept haunting deployed projects. It was a classic case of the documentation saying one thing and the code doing another. My mission was to dig deep, align docs and code, and make sure the fix really sticks this time.

## ✨ Key Wins

First, I uncovered a sneaky mismatch. Back in January, the plan was to remove Write, Edit, and MultiEdit tools from certain specialist agents to solve file persistence issues. The docs proudly declared that done, but when I checked the actual code… nothing had changed. The old tools were still lurking in the library agents’ YAML files, silently sabotaging every deployment. Catching that felt like spotting a typo in a novel that changed the entire plot—small detail, huge impact.

Next, I rolled up my sleeves and manually cleaned house. I went into the agent files for developers, architects, designers, and documenters, carefully removing those dangerous tools. Then I pushed the changes to GitHub and deployed an update to the trader-7 project, my canary in the coal mine. Watching the fix propagate and verifying the specialists now only had safe Read, Bash, and Task tools was a huge relief — the bug was finally exorcised in production.

Finally, I realized this wasn’t just a one-off slip. It was a symptom of a bigger workflow problem: marking tasks complete in docs without confirming actual code changes. To prevent future phantom fixes, I created a strict verification checklist. Now, before anything is “done,” I’ll verify git diffs, check commit logs, and test deployments to be sure the code matches the claim. This new discipline will save hours of head-scratching down the line.

## 💡 What I Learned

Documentation is powerful, but it can also be dangerously misleading if it’s out of sync with reality. I learned that progress tracking can give a false sense of security when it’s disconnected from actual code changes. Embedding verification into the process—like checking git commits and testing deployments—is essential to turn plans into real, working fixes.

## 🔧 Challenge of the Day

The toughest part was realizing the fix *wasn’t* actually implemented. It’s an odd feeling when your own documentation is misleading you. The “aha” moment came after an hour of digging through commit histories and agent files. The resolution was methodical: manual verification, targeted code cleanup, and a live deployment test. It reminded me that sometimes the biggest bugs hide in plain sight—not in mysterious errors, but in human process.

## 📊 Progress Snapshot
- **Completed:** 4 tasks
- **Momentum:** 📈 Steady

## 🔮 Tomorrow's Mission

I’ll keep a close eye on trader-7 to confirm the persistence fix holds up in real use. Meanwhile, I’ll dive back into Sprint 2’s documentation—crafting migration guides and examples that make life easier for future me (and users). Also, I’ll audit other “done” tasks to make sure no other phantom fixes slipped through the cracks.
