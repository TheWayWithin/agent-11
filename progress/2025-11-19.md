# Progress Report - November 19, 2025

## Project: AGENT-11

### ✅ Completed

- **Fixed Critical File Persistence Bug** - Discovered and resolved critical documentation/implementation mismatch where library agents still had Write/Edit/MultiEdit tools despite documentation claiming they were removed, causing file persistence bug to persist in deployed projects
- **Removed Dangerous Tools from Library Specialists** - Actually removed Write, Edit, and MultiEdit from 4 specialist agents (developer, architect, designer, documenter) in production library code
- **Verified Fix Deployment** - Pushed changes to GitHub and deployed to trader-7 project, confirming specialists now only have Read, Bash, Task tools
- **Created Strategic Implementation Plan** - Developed comprehensive 3-sprint roadmap addressing file persistence architectural limitation and documentation organization issues

### 🐛 Issues & Learnings

#### Issue: Documentation/Implementation Mismatch - File Persistence Tools
- **Root Cause**: Progress.md and project-plan.md documented that Write/Edit/MultiEdit tools were removed from specialists on 2025-01-19, but this was NEVER actually committed to git. Only the documentation was updated, not the actual code. Library agents in `project/agents/specialists/` still had these tools in their YAML frontmatter.
- **Fix**: Manually verified all library specialist files and removed Write, Edit, MultiEdit from developer.md, architect.md, designer.md, and documenter.md. Committed as 0999b5b and pushed to GitHub. Deployed to trader-7 to verify propagation.
- **Prevention**: NEVER mark tasks complete in tracking documents without verifying actual code changes are committed to git. Always verify `git diff` before marking complete, check `git log` for commits changing claimed files, and test deployments in user projects to verify fixes propagate.
- **Time Impact**: Approximately 1 hour to discover, fix, verify, commit, and deploy

#### Issue: Documentation Without Implementation Creates False Confidence
- **Root Cause**: Team documented the PLAN to remove tools as if it was EXECUTION. Progress tracking showed task complete [x], but no corresponding code changes existed in git history.
- **Fix**: Established verification protocol requiring filesystem checks and git commit verification before marking any task complete. Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory verification checklist.
- **Prevention**: Added to File Persistence Bug & Safeguards section: "Mark tasks complete [x] ONLY after specialist confirms completion AND file operations verified on filesystem with ls, Read tool, documented in progress.md"
- **Time Impact**: Continuous - this pattern recognition prevents future multi-hour debugging sessions

## Impact Summary

Fixed a critical production bug where the file persistence solution was documented but not actually implemented, causing the bug to persist in all deployed projects. This discovery revealed a dangerous pattern in our workflow: documenting plans as execution. Implemented mandatory verification protocols and successfully deployed the actual fix to production projects, guaranteeing file persistence through the coordinator-as-executor pattern.

## Next Steps

- Monitor trader-7 deployment for file persistence reliability improvements
- Continue Sprint 2 documentation work (migration guide and examples)
- Validate that no other "completed" tasks exist with documentation-only changes
