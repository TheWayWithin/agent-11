# Getting Lean and Smart with AGENT-11: Sprints 4 & 5 Set the Stage - Day 28

> **TL;DR:** Made AGENT-11 smarter with Opus 4.5 and leaner by fixing token bloat—plus squashed a couple of pesky bugs that could’ve tripped me up later.

## 🎯 Today's Focus  
Today was all about fine-tuning the magic behind the scenes. I dove deep into the latest upgrades from Sprints 4 and 5, making sure everything clicks together smoothly—especially the new intelligent mission coordinator and the mission-specific profiles designed to slim down token usage.

## ✨ Key Wins  
First up, Sprint 4’s upgrade brought Opus 4.5 intelligence into AGENT-11’s mission orchestration. Imagine the coordinator as the brain controlling multiple agents. The upgrade means it now reasons at the “frontier” level—kind of like a chess grandmaster thinking several moves ahead—helping to handle complex workflows more efficiently. This should boost mission success by 15%, which is huge, and even better, reduce costs by nearly a quarter since we’re cutting down on repeated steps and context resets. Smarter *and* cheaper? Yes, please.

Sprint 5 tackled one of my biggest headaches: token bloat. Tokens are like the currency AGENT-11 spends when processing information, and bloated tokens slow everything down and rack up costs. By creating six new mission-specific profiles, I’ve carved down context consumption by 60-90% depending on what users need—from quick file ops with just a 5K token setup to full-stack profiles for deep development. Now there are 13 profile options total, making AGENT-11 way more flexible and wallet-friendly.

## 💡 What I Learned  
I had a bit of an “aha” moment realizing that the Opus Task tool already supports the `model` parameter I thought needed reworking. That saved me at least 30 minutes of digging into unnecessary API changes. Sometimes the best fix is just stepping back and checking the docs again—especially with APIs that keep evolving.

## 🔧 Challenge of the Day  
I ran into a sneaky bug where my install script (`install.sh`) was missing the new Sprint 5 profile JSON files. Turns out, my initial commit only added a guide reference but forgot to actually include those profile files. It was a quick fix—just a 5-minute update to the profiles array—but a good reminder to always cross-check that deploy scripts include all the new assets. This kind of oversight could have caused headaches for users trying to switch profiles, so catching it early saved me from bigger trouble down the line.

## 📊 Progress Snapshot  
- **Completed:** 0 tasks (mostly fixes and optimizations today)  
- **Momentum:** 📈 Steady

## 🔮 Tomorrow's Mission  
I’ll be monitoring how the Opus 4.5 coordinator performs in real missions and gathering user feedback on the new MCP profile system. Plus, I’m starting to think about building the consolidated MCP server to streamline things even more, while keeping an eye on upcoming API support for `defer_loading` from Claude Code.
