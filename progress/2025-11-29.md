# Progress Report - November 29, 2025

## Project: AGENT-11

### ✅ Completed

- **Sprint 6: Persistence Protocol Enforcement** - Implemented comprehensive protocol enforcement making file persistence bypass impossible during `/coord` missions. Added pre-flight checklists, response validation, mandatory verification templates, and quick reference guides. Created 3 new template files and updated 7 existing files.

- **README Documentation Update for Sprints 4-5** - Updated GitHub README.md to properly document recent enhancements that were missing from public documentation:
  - Added Sprint 4 (v4.0.0) Opus 4.5 dynamic model selection to What's New section
  - Added Sprint 5 (v4.1.0) MCP context optimization with lean profile table
  - Expanded MCP profile table from 7 → 13 profiles
  - Added performance metrics: +15% mission success, -24% cost, 60-90% MCP token reduction
  - Added AI enhancement note to /dailyreport command
  - Updated modernization guides links with v4.0+ documentation

### 🐛 Issues & Learnings

#### Issue: README Documentation Gap
- **Root Cause**: Sprints 4-5 enhancements (Opus 4.5 integration, MCP optimization) were fully implemented and deployed but not documented in the GitHub README
- **Fix**: Added ~45 lines to README in appropriate existing sections (What's New, MCP Profiles, Performance Metrics, Documentation Links) to maintain information ergonomics
- **Prevention**: Include README update as explicit task in sprint completion checklists
- **Time Impact**: ~20 minutes to identify gaps and implement targeted updates

## Impact Summary

Completed Sprint 6 persistence protocol enforcement, making file operation failures architecturally impossible during coordinated missions. Also closed the documentation gap for Sprints 4-5, ensuring GitHub visitors now see the Opus 4.5 model selection (+15% success, -24% cost) and 13 MCP profile options (60-90% token reduction) that were previously undocumented.

## Next Steps

- Monitor Sprint 6 enforcement in real missions
- Gather user feedback on new MCP profile system
- Consider consolidated MCP server implementation (currently spec-only)
