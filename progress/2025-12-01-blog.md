# Day 43: Shipping Social Media Automation for Build-in-Public

*December 1, 2025*

Today I completed Sprint 7 of AGENT-11, and it's one of those features that will pay dividends every single day going forward.

## The Problem I Solved

I've been building AGENT-11 in public, sharing progress on Twitter/X and LinkedIn. But here's the thing - after a full day of coding, the last thing I want to do is manually craft two separate posts optimized for two different platforms.

Twitter wants punchy, 71-100 character hooks with strategic hashtags. LinkedIn wants 800-1000 character stories with engagement questions. Both need links. Both need to feel authentic, not robotic.

So I automated it.

## What I Built

Extended the `/dailyreport` command to generate platform-optimized social media posts alongside the blog content. Now when I run the command:

```
/dailyreport

Files ready:
   - /progress/2025-12-01.md (raw report)
   - /progress/2025-12-01-blog.md (blog post)
   - /progress/2025-12-01-twitter.md (Twitter/X)
   - /progress/2025-12-01-linkedin.md (LinkedIn)
```

Four files. One command. Copy-paste ready.

## The Technical Implementation

Rather than creating a new script, I extended the existing `enhance_dailyreport.py` with four new methods:

- `generate_social_media_prompt()` - Creates the LLM prompt for both platforms
- `generate_social_content()` - Generates and validates content
- `format_twitter_output()` - Formats with character count validation
- `format_linkedin_output()` - Formats with hook length validation

The key insight: a single LLM call generates both platforms' content, keeping costs at ~$0.002 per complete report.

## Why This Matters

Building in public is a growth strategy, but it only works if you actually post consistently. Now there's zero friction between "finished coding" and "shared on social media."

At $0.002 per day, that's $0.73 per year to save 15-20 minutes daily. The ROI is almost embarrassing to calculate.

## What's Next

Sprint 7 closes out a productive stretch for AGENT-11:
- Sprint 4: Opus 4.5 integration (+15% mission success)
- Sprint 5: MCP optimization (60-90% token reduction)
- Sprint 6: Persistence protocol enforcement
- Sprint 7: Social media automation

The foundation is solid. Time to start building real projects on top of it.
