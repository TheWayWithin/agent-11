Shipped social media automation for my daily reports.

Here's the problem I solved:

After a full day of building, I still needed to:
- Write a Twitter post (punchy, 71-100 chars)
- Write a LinkedIn post (storytelling, 800-1000 chars)
- Make both feel authentic
- Include the right links and hashtags

That's 15-20 minutes of friction between "done coding" and "shared with the world."

So I automated it.

Now one command generates:
- The raw progress report
- A blog-ready narrative
- A Twitter/X post
- A LinkedIn post

Cost per day: $0.002
Time saved: 15-20 minutes

That's $0.73/year to automate my entire build-in-public workflow.

What repetitive task are you still doing manually that could be automated?
