Fixed a frustrating AI workflow problem today.

Here's what was happening:

I'd complete Phase 2 of a multi-agent mission. Step away. Come back. And Claude would start Phase 2 again from scratch.

Why? Stale tracking files. Handoff notes not updated. Progress.md showing tasks incomplete.

I was seeing ~70% compliance with file updates. Sounds okay until you realize that 30% failure rate across dozens of phase transitions means frequent wasted work.

The root cause? Everything was advisory.

"Remember to update files."
"Make sure to verify."

Under cognitive load, suggestions get skipped.

So I replaced advisory protocols with blocking gates.

Four gates now guard every mission:
- Session Resumption Gate (staleness check)
- Phase Gate (5 verification checkpoints)
- Pre-Clear Gate (mandatory sync before /clear)
- Mission Completion Gate (final checklist)

You literally cannot proceed without updates passing.

Results:
- 70% compliance → 99.9%+
- Repeated work → Near-zero
- Staleness detection → Automatic

The insight that drove this:

Don't ask AI to remember. Make it impossible to forget.

What workflow friction are you solving with structural changes instead of behavioral ones?
