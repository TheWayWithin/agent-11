# Project Plan: AGENT-11 Modernization & Claude Code SDK Integration

## Mission Objective
Completely modernize the AGENT-11 framework to leverage Claude Code's latest capabilities including native memory tools, enhanced MCP integration, checkpoint system, and extended thinking modes. Transform AGENT-11 from an already powerful agent coordination system into a state-of-the-art platform that fully leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5's capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This modernization initiative implements recommendations from a comprehensive expert panel analysis of AGENT-11. The goal is to enhance the framework's effectiveness by 39% through memory tool integration, reduce token consumption by 84% through strategic context editing, and enable extended autonomous operation periods (30+ hours) while maintaining AGENT-11's core advantage of seamless Claude Code integration.

## Strategic Context
- **Current State**: Documentation-based agent coordination system with manual context management
- **Target State**: Native Claude Code SDK integration with persistent memory, optimized agent definitions, and sophisticated mission workflows
- **Key Constraint**: All improvements must work within Claude Code's environment (no external infrastructure)
- **Development Distinction**:
  - Working agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/.claude/agents/` (local development squad)
  - Library agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/project/agents/specialists/` (what we're modernizing)
