# AGENT-11 Project Plans

**Project Lead**: Jamie Watters
**Start Date**: 2025-08-01

## CURRENT MISSION: Repository Enhancement Project (PRD Implementation)

**Objective**: Transform Agent-11 into world-class deployment system for solopreneurs  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (adjusted from 5 based on strategic analysis)  
**Target**: 95% deployment success rate, <5 minute time-to-first-success  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Format Standardization  

### Strategic Insights (from @strategist)
- **Risk Mitigation Priority**: Format inconsistency is highest risk factor  
- **Success Factor**: User-centric design for solo entrepreneur persona  
- **Scope Adjustment**: MVP focuses on Core Squad deployment, defer Full Squad to v1.1  
- **Timeline**: 6-week implementation provides buffer for quality assurance
