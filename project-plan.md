# Mission: Foundation Document Guardrails Enhancement

## Executive Summary
Users report that agents sometimes deviate from foundation documents (architecture.md, ideation.md, PRDs, product descriptions). This undermines consistency and creates products that don't match the original vision.

## Mission Objectives
- [ ] Investigate how agents currently handle foundation documents
- [ ] Analyze patterns of deviation and root causes
- [ ] Design guardrail improvements to enforce foundation adherence
- [ ] Implement verification protocols in library agents
- [ ] Validate guardrails with realistic test scenarios
- [ ] Document best practices for foundation document usage

## Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis
- [ ] Review library agent prompts for foundation document instructions
- [ ] Identify which agents are most likely to deviate
- [ ] Analyze current verification protocols (if any)
- [ ] Document deviation patterns from user reports
- [ ] Identify gaps in current guardrails

## Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Determine WHY agents deviate from foundation documents
- [ ] Identify missing verification checkpoints
- [ ] Analyze prompt language that enables deviation
- [ ] Map decision-making flow for architecture adherence
- [ ] Document specific failure scenarios

## Phase 3: Guardrail Design
- [ ] Design mandatory foundation document reading protocol
- [ ] Create architecture verification checkpoints
- [ ] Design product description adherence mechanisms
- [ ] Develop self-verification protocols for agents
- [ ] Create escalation protocols when deviation detected

## Phase 4: Implementation
- [ ] Update library agents with new guardrails
- [ ] Add foundation document reading requirements
- [ ] Implement verification checkpoints
- [ ] Add self-correction mechanisms
- [ ] Update agent protocols and behavioral guidelines

## Phase 5: Validation
- [ ] Test agents with realistic foundation documents
- [ ] Verify adherence to architecture specifications
- [ ] Test deviation detection and correction
- [ ] Validate escalation protocols
- [ ] Measure improvement in consistency

## Success Metrics
- Agents consistently reference foundation documents before decisions
- Zero architectural deviations without explicit user approval
- Product deliverables match foundation specifications
- User confidence in consistency restored
- Clear audit trail of foundation document adherence
