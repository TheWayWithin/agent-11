# Project Plan: AGENT-11 Modernization & Claude Code SDK Integration

## Mission Objective
Completely modernize the AGENT-11 framework to leverage Claude Code's latest capabilities including native memory tools, enhanced MCP integration, checkpoint system, and extended thinking modes. Transform AGENT-11 from an already powerful agent coordination system into a state-of-the-art platform that fully leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5's capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This modernization initiative implements recommendations from a comprehensive expert panel analysis of AGENT-11. The goal is to enhance the framework's effectiveness by 39% through memory tool integration, reduce token consumption by 84% through strategic context editing, and enable extended autonomous operation periods (30+ hours) while maintaining AGENT-11's core advantage of seamless Claude Code integration.

## Strategic Context
- **Current State**: Documentation-based agent coordination system with manual context management
- **Target State**: Native Claude Code SDK integration with persistent memory, optimized agent definitions, and sophisticated mission workflows
- **Key Constraint**: All improvements must work within Claude Code's environment (no external infrastructure)
- **Development Distinction**:
  - Working agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/.claude/agents/` (local development squad)
  - Library agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/project/agents/specialists/` (what we're modernizing)

## AGENT REVIEW MISSION (October 18, 2025)

### Mission Objective
Conduct comprehensive review of all 15 agent files in `.claude/agents/` directory to assess context management efficiency and security guardrails.

### Review Scope
**Efficiency Assessment**:
- Context management capabilities (strategic /clear usage, memory integration)
- Token usage optimization
- Extended thinking allocation appropriateness

**Security Assessment**:
- Tool permission restrictions
- Delegation enforcement
- Separation of duties
- High-risk MCP access controls

### Mission Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Files Reviewed**: 15 agent files (6,553 total lines)
- coordinator.md (649 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- developer.md (431 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- strategist.md (342 lines) - ✅ Excellent (most efficient)
- tester.md (591 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- architect.md (454 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- designer.md (433 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- operator.md (367 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- documenter.md (994 lines) - ⚠️ Optional optimization opportunity
- marketer.md (730 lines) - ⚠️ Optional optimization opportunity
- support.md (698 lines) - ⚠️ Optional optimization opportunity
- analyst.md (386 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- agent-optimizer.md (202 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- design-review.md (183 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- content-creator.md (93 lines) - ✅ Excellent
- meeting.md (164 lines) - ✅ Excellent

### Key Findings

**Context Efficiency**:
- Current: 6,553 lines across 15 agents
- Potential optimization: 5,450 lines (17% reduction via template extraction)
- 11 agents optimal as-is, 3 agents have optional template extraction opportunities

**Security Guardrails**: ✅ ALL PASSED
- Tool permissions properly restricted per role
- High-risk MCPs (stripe, railway, netlify, supabase) limited to appropriate agents
- Read-only enforcement for analysis/strategy agents
- Delegation protocols prevent direct specialist contact
- No security vulnerabilities identified

**Extended Thinking Allocation**: ✅ APPROPRIATE
- Ultrathink: architect (system design, highest stakes)
- Think harder: strategist, coordinator (complex planning)
- Think hard: designer, analyst (multi-constraint decisions)
- Think: developer, tester, documenter, operator, marketer, support (routine execution)

**Production Readiness**: ✅ CERTIFIED
- All 15 agents production-ready in current state
- Phase 1 & 2 modernization complete and effective
- Context management protocols robust
- Security model sound
- Optional optimizations identified but not required

### Deliverables
1. **handoff-notes.md** (450 lines) - Complete agent-by-agent analysis with recommendations
2. **Agent Review Summary** - 11 optimal, 3 with optional optimization, 0 critical issues
3. **Optimization Opportunities** - Template extraction could reduce context by 17%

### Recommendations
**Optional Enhancements** (not required for production):
- Extract templates from documenter.md, marketer.md, support.md ✅ COMPLETED
- Move templates to separate reference files ✅ COMPLETED
- Reduce agent file sizes while maintaining full capability ✅ COMPLETED

**No Action Required**:
- All security guardrails functioning correctly
- Context management efficient and effective
- Extended thinking allocation appropriate
- Tool permissions properly restricted

### Context Optimization Implementation ✅ COMPLETE (October 18, 2025)

     - readme-template.md - Professional README format
     - user-guide-template.md - Step-by-step user guide structure
     - troubleshooting-template.md - Diagnostic and troubleshooting format

   - Extracted 1 comprehensive template to `/templates/support/`:
     - response-templates.md - Ticket templates, bug reports, KB articles, metrics, workflows

**Overall Impact**:
- Total Reduction: 1,055 lines across 3 agents (43.6% reduction)
- Squad-Wide Impact: 16.1% reduction (6,553→5,498 lines across 15 agents)
- Zero capability loss - templates accessed on-demand via Read tool
