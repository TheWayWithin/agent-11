# Project Plan: AGENT-11 Modernization & Claude Code SDK Integration

## Mission Objective
Completely modernize the AGENT-11 framework to leverage Claude Code's latest capabilities including native memory tools, enhanced MCP integration, checkpoint system, and extended thinking modes. Transform AGENT-11 from an already powerful agent coordination system into a state-of-the-art platform that fully leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5's capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This modernization initiative implements recommendations from a comprehensive expert panel analysis of AGENT-11. The goal is to enhance the framework's effectiveness by 39% through memory tool integration, reduce token consumption by 84% through strategic context editing, and enable extended autonomous operation periods (30+ hours) while maintaining AGENT-11's core advantage of seamless Claude Code integration.

## Strategic Context
- **Current State**: Documentation-based agent coordination system with manual context management
- **Target State**: Native Claude Code SDK integration with persistent memory, optimized agent definitions, and sophisticated mission workflows
- **Key Constraint**: All improvements must work within Claude Code's environment (no external infrastructure)
- **Development Distinction**:
  - Working agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/.claude/agents/` (local development squad)
  - Library agents: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/agent-11/project/agents/specialists/` (what we're modernizing)

### PHASE 1: Create MCP Profile Files ✅ (October 21, 2025)

**Objective**: Create 7 static JSON profile files for different development scenarios

#### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create .mcp-profiles/ directory
- [x] Create core.json profile (context7, github, filesystem)
- [x] Create testing.json profile (core + playwright)
- [x] Create database-staging.json profile (core + supabase-staging)
- [x] Create database-production.json profile (core + supabase-production with --read-only)
- [x] Create payments.json profile (core + stripe)
- [x] Create deployment.json profile (core + netlify + railway)
- [x] Create fullstack.json profile (all MCPs combined)
- [x] Validate all JSON files
- [x] Test all 7 profiles with symlink switching

#### Deliverables
- ✅ 7 profile JSON files created (`.mcp-profiles/*.json`)
- ✅ All profiles validated (100% pass rate on JSON syntax)
- ✅ Safety features verified (production --read-only flag present)
- ✅ Profile switching mechanism tested and working

#### Testing Results
**Analyst Review** (20 minutes):
- Quality Score: **10/10** - Production ready
- All 7 profiles syntactically valid
- Consistent structure across all files
- Production read-only flag verified (database-production.json:27)
- All environment variables correctly referenced
- Command structures validated
- No critical issues found

**Tester Validation** (12 minutes):
- **100% test pass rate** (7/7 profiles)
- All profiles switch correctly via symlink
- All profiles contain valid JSON
- All profiles have expected MCP counts
- database-production.json has `--read-only` flag ✅
- fullstack.json does NOT contain production DB ✅
- Profile switching mechanism reliable

#### Context Optimization Validated

| Profile | MCPs | Context Usage | Reduction vs Fullstack |
|---------|------|---------------|------------------------|
| core.json | 3 | 3,000 tokens | 80% ✅ |
| testing.json | 4 | 5,500 tokens | 63% ✅ |

- ✅ Production database read-only enforced (`--read-only` flag in args)
- ✅ Production excluded from fullstack.json (intentional)
- ✅ Clear naming convention (staging vs production)
- ✅ Environment variable separation
