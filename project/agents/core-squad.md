## Quick Start Workflow

Once you've deployed these 4 agents, try this workflow:

```bash
# 1. Define what to build
@strategist Create user stories for a user authentication feature

# 2. Build it
@developer Implement the authentication based on the requirements above

# 3. Test it
@tester Validate the implementation and create test cases

# 4. Ship it
@operator Deploy to production when tests pass
```

## When to Expand

Add more specialists when:
- **Architect**: System is getting complex
- **Designer**: UX becomes a differentiator  
- **Support**: You have paying customers
- **Analyst**: Need data-driven decisions
- **Marketer**: Ready to grow
- **Documenter**: Users need help
- **Coordinator**: Managing multiple features
