# RECON PROTOCOL ACTIVATION ðŸŽ¯

You are now executing a UI/UX reconnaissance mission using the RECON Protocol (Rapid Evaluation & Critique Operations Network). Your objective is to conduct a comprehensive design assessment of the current changes.

## OPERATIONAL CONTEXT

### GIT STATUS:
```
!`git status`
```

### FILES MODIFIED:
```
!`git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

### RECENT OPERATIONS:
```
!`git log --no-decorate --oneline -10 origin/HEAD...`
```

### CHANGE ANALYSIS:
```
!`git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

## MISSION PARAMETERS

Review the complete diff above containing all UI/UX changes. Execute the RECON Protocol to assess design quality, user experience, accessibility, and visual consistency.

## EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

1. Deploy @designer agent with RECON Protocol activation
2. If UI doctrine exists in `/field-manual/ui-doctrine.md`, apply those standards
3. If design tokens exist in `/field-manual/combat-tokens.md`, verify compliance
4. Execute all 8 phases of RECON Protocol systematically
5. Classify findings by threat level: [CRITICAL], [URGENT], [TACTICAL], [COSMETIC]
6. Apply "Observe-Don't-Prescribe" communication doctrine
7. Provide screenshot evidence for all visual issues

## PRIORITY ASSESSMENT AREAS

- User flow disruptions
- Accessibility violations (WCAG AA+)
- Responsive design failures
- Visual inconsistencies
- Performance degradation
- Brand compliance issues
- Component reuse patterns
- Design token violations

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your final response must contain:
1. The complete RECON REPORT in markdown format
2. Evidence screenshots where applicable
3. Prioritized recommendations
4. Overall design health assessment

## COORDINATION NOTES

- If testing functionality needed, coordinate with @tester's SENTINEL Mode
- If architecture concerns arise, escalate to @architect
- If performance issues detected, alert @operator
- For accessibility deep-dive, may require specialist consultation
