## 🛠 Core Scripts

### 1. Main Installer (`install.sh`)

Primary deployment script with atomic installation and rollback.

```bash
./deployment/scripts/install.sh [core|full|minimal]
```

**Features:**
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows/WSL)
- Automatic backup before installation
- Agent file validation
- Progress tracking with visual feedback
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Post-install verification

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 95%+ installation success rate
- ✅ <5 minute installation time
- ✅ Automatic recovery from failures
- ✅ Clear error messages and guidance

### 2. Environment Validator (`validate-environment.sh`)

Pre-installation environment checking and auto-fixing.

```bash
./deployment/scripts/validate-environment.sh [quick|full|fix]
```

**Validation Checks:**
- Operating system compatibility
- Required tools availability
- File system permissions
- Available disk space (50MB minimum)
- Directory structure integrity

### 3. Backup Manager (`backup-manager.sh`)

Comprehensive backup and restore system for agents.

```bash
# Create backup
./deployment/scripts/backup-manager.sh create [name]

# List backups
./deployment/scripts/backup-manager.sh list

# Restore from backup
./deployment/scripts/backup-manager.sh restore <backup-id>

# Cleanup old backups
./deployment/scripts/backup-manager.sh cleanup [count]

# Verify backup integrity
./deployment/scripts/backup-manager.sh verify <backup-id>
```

**Features:**
- Timestamped backups with metadata
- Integrity verification
- Automatic cleanup (keeps last 10 by default)
- Safety backups before restoration

### 4. Agent Installer (`agent-installer.sh`)

Individual agent management and validation.

```bash
# List installed agents
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh list-installed

# List available agents
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh list-available

# Install specific agent
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh install <agent-name> [--force]

# Uninstall agent
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh uninstall <agent-name>

# Update agent
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh update <agent-name>

# Validate agent file
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh validate <agent-name>

# Verify all agents
./deployment/scripts/agent-installer.sh verify-all
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Installation Settings (`installation.yaml`)

```yaml
installation:
  target_success_rate: 95
  max_install_time_minutes: 5
  defaults:
    squad_type: "core"
    backup_enabled: true
    validation_enabled: true
    rollback_on_failure: true
```

### Squad Definitions (`squad-definitions.yaml`)

Defines agent compositions, use cases, and upgrade paths for each squad type.

### Core Squad Config (`core-squad.yaml`)

Specific configuration for Core Squad deployment including installation sequence and post-install workflows.

## 🚦 Installation Process

1. **Pre-Install Validation**
   - Environment compatibility check
   - Required tools verification
   - Permission validation
   - Disk space check

2. **Backup Creation**
   - Automatic backup of existing agents
   - Timestamped with metadata
   - Skip if no existing agents

3. **Agent Installation**
   - Sequential installation with progress tracking
   - YAML header validation
   - File integrity verification
   - Error collection for rollback

4. **Post-Install Verification**
   - Verify all agents installed correctly
   - Validate file formats and content
   - Confirm functionality

5. **Rollback on Failure**
   - Automatic rollback if any step fails
   - Restore from backup if available
   - Clean removal if no backup exists
