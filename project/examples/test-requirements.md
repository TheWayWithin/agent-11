# Authentication Feature Requirements

## Overview
We need to add user authentication to our application to secure user data and provide personalized experiences.

## User Stories

### As a new user
- I want to create an account with email and password
- I want to receive a confirmation email
- I want to set up my profile after registration

### As a returning user
- I want to log in with my credentials
- I want to reset my password if forgotten
- I want to stay logged in across sessions

## Technical Requirements

- Secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Email verification system
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- HTTPS only for auth routes

## Success Criteria

- Users can register and log in successfully
- Passwords are securely stored
- Sessions persist for 7 days
- Password reset works reliably
- All auth endpoints are rate-limited
