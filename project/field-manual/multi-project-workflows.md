# Multi-Project Workflows with AGENT-11

*The definitive guide for power users managing multiple projects with specialized AI squads*

## Introduction

AGENT-11's project-local deployment system gives you unprecedented flexibility when managing multiple projects. Each project directory gets its own context-aware squad that understands your specific codebase, requirements, and objectives. This eliminates the confusion and context bleeding that occurs with shared AI assistants.

### Key Benefits

- **Context Isolation**: Each squad operates within its project's specific context
- **Zero Conflicts**: No confusion between different codebases or requirements  
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Agents learn your project's patterns and conventions
- **Seamless Switching**: Move between projects without losing context
- **Scalable Architecture**: Add or remove agents per project needs

## Setup Strategies

### Option A: Consistent Core Squad

## Management Best Practices

### Efficient Project Switching

**Quick Context Switch Protocol:**
```bash
# Save current work
git add . && git commit -m "WIP: current state"

# Switch projects
cd ~/projects/other-project

# Agents automatically load this project's context
@developer "What's the current status of the authentication system?"
```

**Pro Tip**: Use descriptive commit messages before switching projects so agents understand where you left off.

### Customizing Agents Per Project

**Project-Specific Specialization:**
```bash
# Base developer agent
/agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11."

# Add project-specific context
@developer "For this React/TypeScript e-commerce project, always prioritize type safety, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance. Use our custom design system components from /src/components/ui/."
```

**Technology Stack Alignment:**
```bash
# Python/Django project
/agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. For this Django project, follow PEP 8 standards, use Django REST framework patterns, and prioritize database query optimization."

# Node.js/Express project  
/agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. For this Node.js project, use modern ES6+ syntax, implement proper error handling middleware, and follow RESTful API design principles."
```

### Maintaining Squad Consistency

**Configuration Templates:**

Create project-specific deployment scripts:

```bash
# ~/projects/saas-project/deploy-squad.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying TaskFlow squad..."

claude agent strategist "You are THE STRATEGIST, an elite product strategy specialist in AGENT-11. For TaskFlow, focus on small team productivity pain points and competitive positioning against Asana/Trello."

claude agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. For TaskFlow, prioritize React frontend with Node.js backend, emphasizing real-time collaboration features."

echo "Squad deployed successfully!"
```

**Version Control Integration:**

Store agent configurations in your project:

```bash
# .agent-config/squad-deployment.md
## TaskFlow Squad Configuration

### Strategist
- Focus: Small team productivity, competitive analysis
- Key responsibilities: Feature prioritization, market research

### Developer  
- Stack: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Priorities: Real-time features, scalability
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Agent Context Confusion

**Problem**: Agent references wrong project details
**Solution**: Clear context and re-establish project focus

```bash
@developer "I'm working on the TaskFlow project now, not ArtisanMarket. This is a React/Node.js task management app. Please review the current codebase in /src and tell me what you see."
```

### Performance with Multiple Squads

**Problem**: Too many agents across projects affecting performance
**Solution**: Deploy agents only when actively working on projects

```bash
# Clean slate approach
# Only deploy agents for current active project
# Use project-specific deployment scripts for consistency
```

### Cross-Project Knowledge Bleeding

**Problem**: Agent applies patterns from one project to another inappropriately
**Solution**: Explicit project context reinforcement

```bash
@architect "This is the DevAnalyzer Python project, not the TaskFlow React project. Please design the database schema using SQLAlchemy models, not Mongoose schemas."
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Project-Specific Agent Personalities

**Startup vs Enterprise Tone:**
```bash
# Startup project - move fast, iterate quickly
/agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. For this startup MVP, prioritize speed and user feedback over perfect architecture. Ship working features quickly and iterate based on real usage."

# Enterprise project - stability and documentation
/agent developer "You are THE DEVELOPER, an elite full-stack engineer in AGENT-11. For this enterprise system, prioritize stability, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation. Every change should be thoroughly planned and validated."
```

### Squad Scaling Strategies

**Progressive Enhancement:**
1. **Week 1-2**: Solo strategist for market research
2. **Week 3-4**: Add developer for MVP implementation
3. **Week 5-6**: Add tester for quality assurance
4. **Week 7-8**: Add operator for deployment prep
5. **Week 9+**: Add specialists based on traction

**Load Balancing:**
- Use core squad for deep technical work
- Deploy specialists for specific initiatives
- Rotate agents based on project phase

### Cross-Project Knowledge Sharing

**Best Practice Documentation:**
```bash
# Create shared knowledge base
~/agent-knowledge/
├── deployment-patterns.md
├── testing-strategies.md  
├── ui-components.md
└── database-patterns.md

# Reference in project-specific contexts
@developer "Apply the authentication patterns from ~/agent-knowledge/auth-patterns.md to this project's login system."
```

**Template Replication:**
```bash
# Export successful configurations
@documenter "Document our current squad setup and workflows for replication in future projects."

# Import proven patterns
@architect "Use the microservices architecture pattern we documented from the successful TaskFlow project."
```

## Success Metrics

Track your multi-project efficiency:

- **Context Switch Time**: How quickly you can resume work on different projects
- **Agent Accuracy**: How well agents understand project-specific requirements
- **Development Velocity**: Features shipped per project per week
- **Quality Consistency**: Bug rates across different projects
- **Knowledge Retention**: How well agents remember project conventions

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Project health check
@analyst "Review this project's current metrics and health indicators"

# Squad status review
@coordinator "Summarize what each squad member is currently working on"

# Context validation
@strategist "Confirm you understand this project's goals and current priorities"

# Knowledge sync
@documenter "Update project documentation with recent changes and decisions"

# Performance optimization
@operator "Identify any performance bottlenecks in current deployment"
```

**Pro Tip**: The most successful AGENT-11 users treat each project as a separate mission with its own specialized squad. Don't try to force one-size-fits-all approaches - embrace the flexibility to customize your team for each unique challenge.

**Remember**: Your agents are only as effective as the context you provide them. Take time to properly introduce each squad to their specific project, and you'll see dramatically better results across all your work.
