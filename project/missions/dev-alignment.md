# Mission: Dev-Alignment 🎯
## Existing Project Understanding & Setup

### Mission Type
**Project Analysis** - Understanding and aligning with existing codebases

### Estimated Duration
45-60 minutes

### Required Assets
- Existing codebase
- Ideation documents (if available)
- Project documentation
- User context/vision

---

## Mission Briefing

This mission aligns AGENT-11 with an existing project by:
1. Analyzing current codebase structure
2. Understanding project goals and context
3. Reviewing or creating ideation documents
4. Establishing progress tracking
5. Optimizing CLAUDE.md for the specific project

### Prerequisites
- AGENT-11 deployed to existing project
- Access to codebase
- Project context (from docs or user)

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: MCP Assessment (3 min)
```bash
/coord "Discovering available MCPs in the project..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator checks for available MCPs with grep "mcp__"
- Identifies which MCPs are configured
- Maps MCPs to current architecture:
  - If Supabase used: Check for mcp__supabase
  - If tests exist: Check for mcp__playwright
  - For any libraries: Note mcp__context7 availability
- Documents MCP availability in analysis

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Starting project alignment. Let me analyze your existing codebase..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @architect performs codebase audit:
  - Technology stack identification
  - Architecture pattern analysis
  - Dependencies review
  - Code quality assessment
  - Test coverage check
- @developer identifies:
  - Core functionality
  - Integration points
  - Development patterns
  - Build/deployment setup

**Analysis Output:**
```markdown

### Phase 2: Context Discovery (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Now let's understand your project's mission. Do you have ideation documents, or shall we discover the context together?"
```

**Two Paths:**

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist reviews provided documents
- Extracts key objectives
- Identifies gaps in documentation
- Creates consolidated vision

#### Path B: Context Discovery Session
**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist conducts discovery:
  ```
  Questions:
  1. What problem does this project solve?
  2. Who are the target users?
  3. What are the core features?
  4. What's the current status?
  5. What are the immediate goals?
  6. What are the pain points?
  7. What's the vision for success?
  ```
- @documenter creates ideation.md from responses
