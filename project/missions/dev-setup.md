# Mission: Dev-Setup üöÄ
## Greenfield Project Initialization

### Mission Type
**Initial Setup** - Foundation laying for new projects

### Estimated Duration
30-45 minutes

### Required Assets
- Ideation document (PRD, brand guidelines, architecture specs, vision doc)
- GitHub repository name/URL
- Project vision and goals

---

## Mission Briefing

This mission establishes the foundation for a new greenfield project by:
1. Setting up GitHub integration
2. Analyzing ideation documents
3. Creating initial project plan
4. Establishing progress tracking
5. Configuring CLAUDE.md for ongoing development

### Prerequisites
- AGENT-11 deployed to project
- Ideation document prepared
- GitHub repository created (or ready to create)

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: MCP Profile Setup (2 min)

**Recommended**: Start with the `core` profile for lightweight development:
```bash
ln -sf .mcp-profiles/core.json .mcp.json
# Restart Claude Code
```

Switch to specialized profiles as needed (testing, deployment, etc.). See [MCP Profile Guide](../../docs/MCP-GUIDE.md) for details.

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator identifies which MCP profile matches project needs
- Documents profile selection in project-plan.md
- Notes when to switch profiles for specific tasks (testing, deployment)

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup (5 min)
```bash
/coord "Let's set up this greenfield project. First, what's the GitHub repository URL or name for this project?"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator prompts for GitHub details
- Initializes git if needed
- Sets up remote origin
- Creates initial commit structure

### Phase 2: Ideation Analysis (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Please share your ideation document - this could be a PRD, vision doc, brand guidelines, or architecture specs"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist analyzes ideation document
- Extracts key requirements
- Identifies technical constraints
- Maps business objectives
- Notes brand/design requirements

### Phase 3: Architecture Documentation (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating architecture documentation based on ideation and requirements..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @architect creates `architecture.md` using template:
  - System overview and boundaries
  - Infrastructure architecture
  - Application architecture
  - Data architecture
  - Integration points
  - Architecture decisions
  - Current limitations
  - Next steps

**Note**: Uses `/templates/architecture.md` as starting point
**Reference**: See `/project/field-manual/architecture-sop.md` for comprehensive guidelines

### Phase 4: Project Planning (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating initial project plan based on ideation analysis and architecture..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist creates `project-plan.md` with:
  - Executive summary
  - Core objectives
  - Technical architecture (referencing architecture.md)
  - Milestone roadmap
  - Success metrics
  - Risk assessment
  - Resource requirements

**project-plan.md Structure:**
```markdown

## Progress Tracking Protocol

### project-plan.md (FORWARD-LOOKING)
**What we're PLANNING to do**:
- Update when: Mission start, phase start, task completion
- Task lists with checkboxes [ ] ‚Üí [x]
- Milestones, success metrics, risk assessment

### progress.md (BACKWARD-LOOKING CHANGELOG)
**What we DID and what we LEARNED**:
- Update when: After EACH deliverable, after EACH fix attempt, when issue resolved
- Log ALL fix attempts (including failures) - not just final solutions
- Root cause analysis for all issues
- Prevention strategies and lessons learned
- **CRITICAL**: Failed attempts teach us what doesn't work and why

### Update After:
1. **Each Deliverable**: Log to progress.md with description
2. **Each Change**: Record in progress.md with rationale
3. **Issue Discovery**: Create issue entry in progress.md immediately
4. **EACH Fix Attempt**: Log attempt, rationale, result, learning (even if it fails)
5. **Issue Resolution**: Add root cause analysis and prevention strategy
6. **Task Completion**: Mark [x] in project-plan.md
7. **Phase End**: Update both files with results and lessons

## Update Checklist
- [ ] Deliverable created ‚Üí Log in progress.md with description
- [ ] Code/config changed ‚Üí Record in progress.md with rationale
- [ ] Issue discovered ‚Üí Create issue entry in progress.md
- [ ] Fix attempted ‚Üí Log attempt with result and learning in progress.md

## Post-Mission Cleanup Decision

After completing this mission, decide on cleanup approach based on project status:

### ‚úÖ Milestone Transition (Every 2-4 weeks)
**When**: This mission completes a major project milestone, but more work remains.

**Actions** (30-60 min):
1. Extract lessons to `lessons/[category]/` from progress.md
2. Archive current handoff-notes.md to `archives/handoffs/milestone-X/`
3. Clean agent-context.md (retain essentials, archive historical details)
4. Create fresh handoff-notes.md for next milestone
5. Update project-plan.md with next milestone tasks

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section A for detailed steps

### üéØ Project Completion (Mission accomplished!)
**When**: All project objectives achieved, ready for new mission.

**Actions** (1-2 hours):
1. Extract ALL lessons from entire progress.md to `lessons/`
2. Create mission archive in `archives/missions/mission-[name]-YYYY-MM-DD/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md with system-level learnings
4. Archive all tracking files (project-plan.md, progress.md, etc.)
5. Prepare fresh start for next mission

**See**: `templates/cleanup-checklist.md` Section B for detailed steps

### üîÑ Continue Active Work (No cleanup needed)
**When**: Mission complete but continuing active development in same phase.

**Actions**: Update progress.md and project-plan.md, continue working.
