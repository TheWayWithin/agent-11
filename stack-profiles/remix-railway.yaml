  notes: |
    This stack is optimized for developer experience and progressive enhancement.
    Trade-offs:
    - Full Node.js runtime (more flexibility, more to manage)
    - Railway is simpler than AWS but less feature-rich
    - Lucia auth is lighter-weight than Clerk but requires more setup

    When to consider alternatives:
    - Need edge runtime → Use Next.js + Supabase stack
    - Need managed auth → Consider Clerk or Auth0
    - Need real-time → Add Supabase or Pusher
