## Conversion Psychology Principles

### Address Problem First
Don't lead with features. Meet customers where they hurt.

**Bad**: "Our tool has 50+ features"
**Good**: "Tired of spending 3 hours/day on [painful task]?"

### Use Concrete Numbers
Specificity converts better than vague claims.

**Bad**: "Save time and money"
**Good**: "Save 14 hours/week and $3,200/month"

### Show Before/After
Make the transformation tangible and visual.

**Structure**:
- Before: [Painful current state with specific details]
- After: [Desired transformed state with specific outcomes]
- How: [Your product bridges the gap]

### Make Next Step Obvious
Remove friction from the conversion process.

**Elements**:
- Single clear CTA (don't offer multiple competing actions)
- Button text uses action verbs ("Start free trial" not "Learn more")
- No forms longer than 3 fields for initial conversion
- Show value before asking for anything

### Remove Risk
Reduce perceived risk with guarantees.

**Examples**:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- No credit card required
- Cancel anytime
- Free trial, no strings attached

### Create Urgency
Time limits and scarcity drive action.

**Techniques**:
- Limited-time offers with countdown
- Limited quantity ("Only 5 spots left")
- Seasonal relevance ("Before [upcoming event]")
- Event-based urgency ("Launch special expires Monday")
