# Requirements: Team Collaboration & Real-Time Notifications

## Executive Summary
Add real-time collaboration features to the task management platform, enabling teams to see live updates when tasks are created, edited, or completed. Users will receive instant browser notifications for @mentions, task assignments, and project updates without needing to refresh the page. This addresses the #1 user request (mentioned in 127 support tickets) and closes the gap with competitors like Asana and Monday.com.

**Business Value**: Expected to increase user retention by 25%, reduce "Why didn't I see this update?" support tickets by 60%, and improve team collaboration NPS score from 6.5 to 8.5.

## Core Features & User Stories

### User Story 1: Real-Time Task Updates
- **As a** team member viewing the task board
- **I want** to see task changes appear instantly when teammates create or update tasks
- **So that** I always have the current view without manually refreshing the page

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When another user creates a task, it appears on my board within 2 seconds without page refresh
- [ ] When another user updates a task title or status, the change reflects on my view immediately
- [ ] When another user deletes a task, it disappears from my view within 2 seconds
- [ ] Changes include smooth animations (fade-in for new tasks, color pulse for updates)
- [ ] A subtle indicator shows "3 updates" if I'm viewing a different tab when changes occur
- [ ] Clicking the indicator scrolls to show new/updated tasks

**Technical Notes:**
- Use WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Fall back to polling (every 5 seconds) if WebSocket unavailable
- Implement optimistic updates for user's own actions

### User Story 2: @Mention Notifications
- **As a** user mentioned in a task comment or description
- **I want** to receive an instant browser notification
- **So that** I can respond quickly to requests for my input or action

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When someone @mentions me, I receive browser notification within 2 seconds
- [ ] Notification shows: task title, who mentioned me, and preview of message
- [ ] Clicking notification navigates directly to the task and highlights my mention
- [ ] Notification appears even if I have the app open in a background tab
- [ ] Notifications are grouped: "3 new mentions" if multiple @mentions within 1 minute
- [ ] I can mute notifications per project from project settings
- [ ] I can set "Do Not Disturb" hours in user preferences (e.g., 6pm - 9am)

**Technical Notes:**
- Requires browser Notification API permission
- Store notification preferences in user settings
- Handle notification permission denied gracefully (fallback to in-app notifications)

### User Story 3: Task Assignment Notifications
- **As a** user assigned to a new task
- **I want** to be notified immediately when a task is assigned to me
- **So that** I can review it and plan my work accordingly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When assigned a task, I receive browser notification within 2 seconds
- [ ] Notification shows: task title, who assigned it, due date, and priority
- [ ] Clicking notification opens the task details modal
- [ ] Notification includes quick action buttons: "Accept" and "View Details"
- [ ] Clicking "Accept" acknowledges assignment without opening full task
- [ ] Unacknowledged assignments show red badge count in app header
- [ ] Email digest sent if assignment not acknowledged within 1 hour (configurable)

**Technical Notes:**
- Track assignment acknowledgment status in database
- Email digest system should batch notifications to avoid spam
- Consider priority: P0/P1 tasks might warrant more urgent notifications

### User Story 4: Live Presence Indicators
- **As a** team member collaborating on tasks
- **I want** to see who else is currently viewing or editing a task
- **So that** I can coordinate with them or avoid conflicting edits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When viewing a task, I see avatars of other users currently viewing it
- [ ] Avatars show max 5 users, with "+3 more" indicator if more present
- [ ] When someone starts editing a task field, I see a "typing" indicator on that field
- [ ] If I try to edit a field someone else is editing, I see warning: "Jane is currently editing this field"
- [ ] When someone saves changes while I'm editing, I receive conflict resolution prompt
- [ ] Presence indicators update in real-time (within 1 second)
- [ ] User goes "offline" if inactive for 2 minutes or closes tab

**Technical Notes:**
- Use WebSocket heartbeat (every 30 seconds) to track active users
- Implement operational transformation or last-write-wins for conflict resolution
- Store presence data in Redis (ephemeral, not database)

### User Story 5: Activity Feed with Real-Time Updates
- **As a** project manager
- **I want** to see a live feed of all team activity (tasks created, completed, comments)
- **So that** I can monitor progress and identify blockers quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Activity feed shows real-time updates as they happen (within 2 seconds)
- [ ] Feed includes: task creation, task completion, status changes, comments, assignments
- [ ] Each activity item shows: user avatar, action, task name, timestamp ("2 minutes ago")
- [ ] Feed auto-scrolls to show new activity, with "New activity" indicator if I scroll up
- [ ] I can filter feed by: all activity, only my tasks, specific team member, specific project
- [ ] Feed shows up to 100 most recent items, with "Load more" for history
- [ ] Export activity feed as CSV for reporting (date range filter)

**Technical Notes:**
- Activity feed stored in database (activities table)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket broadcast to project members
- Implement virtual scrolling for performance (render only visible items)
- Consider pagination limits for large projects (1000+ activities)

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **WebSocket connection establishment**: < 1 second after page load
- **Notification delivery latency**: < 2 seconds from action to all connected clients
- **Optimistic UI updates**: Instant for user's own actions (no waiting for server)
- **Presence indicator update**: < 1 second when user joins/leaves
- **Activity feed render**: < 300ms for initial 100 items
- **Concurrent users supported**: 500 simultaneous connections per project
- **Message throughput**: Handle 100 events/second per project without degradation

**Benchmarks to test:**
- 50 users editing tasks simultaneously (measure latency)
- 100 notifications triggered within 1 minute (no drops)
- WebSocket reconnection after network interruption (< 5 seconds)

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: WebSocket connection must validate JWT token before establishing
- **Authorization**: Users only receive events for projects they have access to
- **Message encryption**: All WebSocket messages encrypted with TLS (wss://)
- **Rate limiting**: Max 50 events/minute per user to prevent notification spam attacks
- **Input validation**:
  - Sanitize @mentions to prevent XSS in notifications
  - Validate task IDs before broadcasting updates
  - Escape user-generated content in notification previews
- **Permission checks**: Verify user has read access before sending task updates

**Security tests:**
- Attempt to connect with expired token (should reject)
- Try to subscribe to project user doesn't have access to (should reject)
- Send malicious payload in @mention (should sanitize)
- Exceed rate limit (should throttle)

### Integration Requirements
- **WebSocket server**: Socket.IO v4.6+ or Pusher (evaluate cost)
  - Self-hosted Socket.IO on Railway if <1000 concurrent users
  - Upgrade to Pusher if >1000 concurrent users or need better scaling
- **Browser Notification API**: Check permission, handle denied state gracefully
- **Email service**: SendGrid for notification digests (already integrated)
- **Analytics**: Track notification delivery rate, click-through rate, mute frequency
- **Monitoring**: Datadog or New Relic for WebSocket connection health

**Integration tests:**
- Verify notifications trigger emails if not acknowledged within 1 hour
- Confirm analytics events fire for notification interactions
- Test WebSocket failover to polling if connection drops

## Business Rules & Constraints

### Business Logic
1. **Notification Muting**: Users can mute notifications per project, but P0 (critical) tasks always notify
2. **Rate Limiting**: Max 10 browser notifications per hour per user to avoid notification fatigue
3. **Batching**: If 5+ events occur within 1 minute, batch into single notification: "15 updates in Project Alpha"
4. **Presence Timeout**: Users marked "away" after 2 minutes of inactivity, "offline" after 5 minutes
5. **Activity Retention**: Activity feed stores last 90 days, archives older data to cold storage
6. **@Mention Validation**: Only mention users who have access to the project (no external emails)

### Technical Constraints
- **Budget limit**: $200/month for WebSocket infrastructure (max 2000 concurrent connections)
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks development, 1 week QA, 1 week beta testing (6 weeks total)
- **Technology stack**:
  - Frontend: React 18 with Socket.IO client
  - Backend: Node.js Express with Socket.IO server
  - Database: PostgreSQL for activity feed, Redis for presence data
  - Hosting: Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)
- **Hosting requirements**:
  - WebSocket server must support sticky sessions (load balancer affinity)
  - Redis instance with 2GB memory for presence data
  - PostgreSQL needs 500MB storage for activity feed (90-day retention)

**Cost estimates:**
- Railway: $50/month (WebSocket server + Redis)
- Database storage: $20/month (PostgreSQL expansion)
- SendGrid: $30/month (increased email volume for digests)
- Monitoring: $50/month (Datadog WebSocket metrics)
- **Total**: $150/month (within $200 budget)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**High Risk: WebSocket connection stability at scale**
- **Impact**: Dropped connections cause missed notifications, poor user experience
- **Probability**: Medium (60%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Fall back to polling (every 5 seconds) if WebSocket unavailable
  - Load test with 1000 concurrent users before launch
  - Monitor connection drop rate, alert if >2%
- **Contingency**: Have polling-only mode ready as rollback option

**High Risk: Browser notification permission denial**
- **Impact**: Users don't grant permission, miss notifications
- **Probability**: High (40% of users typically deny notification permissions)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Explain value before requesting permission ("Get instant updates when you're mentioned")
  - Provide in-app notification fallback (toast messages)
  - Allow users to enable later from settings
  - Show success stories from teams using notifications
- **Contingency**: In-app notifications work for all users regardless of browser permissions

**Medium Risk: Notification fatigue causing users to mute**
- **Impact**: Users disable notifications, reducing feature value
- **Probability**: Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Smart batching: Group 5+ events into single notification
  - Rate limiting: Max 10 browser notifications per hour
  - Allow granular control: Mute specific projects, set DND hours
  - Analytics to identify optimal notification frequency
- **Contingency**: Adjust rate limits based on mute frequency metrics

**Medium Risk: Real-time updates cause UI performance issues**
- **Impact**: App becomes sluggish with many concurrent updates
- **Probability**: Low-Medium (20%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement virtual scrolling for activity feed
  - Throttle UI updates (max 1 render per 500ms)
  - Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Load test with high event frequency (100 events/min)
- **Contingency**: Add "Pause live updates" toggle for users in high-activity projects

### Market Risks

**Competition: Users expect feature parity with Asana/Monday.com**
- **Impact**: Users churn to competitors if our notifications are inferior
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Conduct competitive analysis of Asana/Monday notification features
  - Implement must-have features: @mentions, assignments, real-time updates
  - Beta test with users familiar with competitors to validate parity
- **Contingency**: Fast-follow features based on beta feedback

**User Adoption: Teams may not adopt if not enough perceived value**
- **Impact**: Low usage of feature after launch
- **Probability**: Low (20%) - feature is #1 requested
- **Mitigation**:
  - Launch with in-app tooltips and onboarding flow
  - Email campaign highlighting benefits with video demo
  - Track adoption metrics, iterate quickly on friction points
- **Contingency**: Add more compelling use cases based on analytics

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **WebSocket stability**: Load test with 2x expected capacity, have polling fallback
2. **Notification permissions**: Multi-layered approach (browser + in-app + email)
3. **Notification fatigue**: Smart batching + rate limiting + granular controls
4. **UI performance**: Optimize rendering, load test with high event frequency
5. **Adoption**: Strong onboarding + education + quick iteration on feedback
