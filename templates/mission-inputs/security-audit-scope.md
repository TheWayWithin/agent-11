# Security Audit Scope: Pre-Launch Security Review

## Audit Overview

### Audit Type
- [x] **Pre-Launch Security Review** - Comprehensive audit before production deployment
- [ ] **Periodic Security Audit** - Regular scheduled security assessment
- [ ] **Incident Response Audit** - Post-breach security investigation
- [ ] **Compliance Audit** - Specific regulatory requirement (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA)
- [ ] **Third-Party Integration Audit** - Security review of external API integration

### Business Context
**Why Now**: Launching MVP to first 100 paying customers in 2 weeks. Need confidence that:
1. User data is protected (passwords, API keys, personal info)
2. Authentication/authorization is secure (no unauthorized access)
3. Payment processing meets PCI DSS standards (Stripe integration)
4. No critical vulnerabilities that could cause breach or downtime
5. Basic compliance requirements met (GDPR consent, data retention)

**Consequences of Security Failure**:
- **Reputational damage**: Startup reputation destroyed by early breach
- **Financial loss**: GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% of revenue (€50k for startup)
- **Customer churn**: 100% churn if user data leaked in first month
- **Legal liability**: Lawsuits from affected customers
- **Business shutdown**: Unable to recover from early security incident

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero critical vulnerabilities (authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS)
- Fix or mitigate all high-severity issues before launch
- Document medium/low issues with remediation timeline
- Receive written security sign-off from auditor

## Scope of Audit

### In-Scope Systems & Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**What to audit:**
- **User registration flow**: Email validation, password requirements, duplicate account prevention
- **Login system**: Password hashing (bcrypt with salt), brute force protection, account lockout
- **JWT tokens**: Signature verification, expiration handling, refresh token security
- **Password reset flow**: Token generation, expiration (15 min), single-use enforcement
- **Session management**: Session timeout (60 min), concurrent session handling
- **OAuth integration**: Google OAuth 2.0 implementation (if applicable)
- **2FA implementation**: TOTP setup, backup codes, recovery flow (if implemented)

**Specific checks:**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12+)?
- JWT secrets stored securely (not hardcoded)?
- Refresh tokens revocable and stored securely?
- Password reset tokens single-use and time-limited?
- Rate limiting on login attempts (5 attempts per 15 min)?
- Account lockout after failed attempts (lockout for 30 min)?

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Authentication flaws enable unauthorized access

#### 2. Data Protection & Privacy
**What to audit:**
- **Data at rest encryption**: Database encryption (AES-256), backup encryption
- **Data in transit encryption**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all connections, no mixed content
- **Sensitive data handling**: PII, passwords, API keys, payment info
- **Data retention policies**: User data deletion, backup retention (90 days)
- **Access controls**: Role-based access (admin, user, guest), permission checks on every API call
- **Audit logging**: Who accessed what data, when, and from where

**Specific checks:**
- All HTTP endpoints redirect to HTTPS?
- TLS 1.3 enforced (no TLS 1.0/1.1)?
- Passwords never logged or stored in plaintext?
- PII encrypted in database (email, phone, address)?
- User can delete account and all data (GDPR right to erasure)?
- Audit logs track admin access to user data?

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Data breaches have severe consequences

#### 3. API Security
**What to audit:**
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT except public routes (/health, /login, /register)
- **Authorization**: Users can only access their own data (no horizontal privilege escalation)
- **Input validation**: All user inputs validated (length, type, format, whitelist)
- **Output encoding**: Prevent XSS via JSON encoding, HTML escaping
- **Rate limiting**: Per-user rate limits (100 req/min), global rate limits (10k req/min)
- **CORS policy**: Strict origin whitelist, no wildcard (*) allowed
- **Error handling**: Generic error messages (no stack traces or sensitive info exposed)

**Endpoints to test:**
```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh-token
POST /api/auth/forgot-password
POST /api/auth/reset-password

GET  /api/users/:id
PUT  /api/users/:id
DELETE /api/users/:id

GET  /api/projects
POST /api/projects
GET  /api/projects/:id
PUT  /api/projects/:id
DELETE /api/projects/:id

GET  /api/tasks
POST /api/tasks
GET  /api/tasks/:id
PUT  /api/tasks/:id
DELETE /api/tasks/:id

POST /api/payments/checkout
POST /api/payments/webhook  (Stripe webhook, HMAC verification)
```

**Specific checks:**
- Can user A access user B's data by changing `:id` parameter? (IDOR test)
- Can unauthenticated user access protected endpoints?
- Can regular user access admin-only endpoints?
- SQL injection attempts blocked? (test with `'; DROP TABLE users; --`)
- XSS attempts blocked? (test with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`)
- Rate limiting enforced? (test with 150 req/min)

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - API vulnerabilities enable data theft

#### 4. Frontend Security
**What to audit:**
- **XSS prevention**: Content Security Policy (CSP) configured, user input sanitized
- **CSRF protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens on state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Check npm packages for known CVEs (`npm audit`)
- **Secure storage**: No sensitive data in localStorage (JWT in httpOnly cookies preferred)
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: CDN scripts have integrity hashes
- **Click-jacking prevention**: X-Frame-Options: DENY or Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors

**Specific checks:**
- CSP header present and strict? (`default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'`)
- User input rendered with React escaping (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization)?
- JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie or secure storage (not localStorage)?
- npm audit shows zero high/critical vulnerabilities?
- External scripts (Google Analytics, etc.) loaded with SRI?

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Frontend vulnerabilities enable account takeover

#### 5. Payment Processing (Stripe Integration)
**What to audit:**
- **PCI DSS compliance**: Credit card data never touches our servers (Stripe Elements used)
- **Webhook verification**: Stripe webhook signatures verified (HMAC with secret)
- **Idempotency**: Duplicate payments prevented (idempotency keys used)
- **Refund handling**: Refund flow secure, authorized users only
- **Error handling**: Payment errors don't expose sensitive info
- **Testing**: Test with Stripe test mode cards (4242424242424242)

**Specific checks:**
- Credit card fields rendered by Stripe Elements (not our forms)?
- Stripe webhook signature verified before processing events?
- Payment confirmation stored securely (no card details)?
- Refund endpoint requires admin authorization?
- Test successful payment, failed payment, webhook replay attack

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Payment vulnerabilities = financial fraud

#### 6. Infrastructure & Deployment
**What to audit:**
- **Environment variables**: Secrets in `.env` files, not committed to git
- **Database security**: Passwords strong (20+ chars), access restricted to app servers
- **Cloud security**: Railway/Vercel security groups, firewall rules
- **Secrets management**: API keys rotated regularly, stored in environment variables
- **Backup security**: Database backups encrypted, access restricted
- **Monitoring**: Security alerts configured (failed logins, admin actions)

**Specific checks:**
- No secrets in git history? (scan with `git secrets` or `truffleHog`)
- Database accessible only from app servers (not public internet)?
- Production environment variables different from dev/staging?
- API keys have least-privilege permissions (Stripe restricted keys)?
- Database backups encrypted and tested for restoration?

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Infrastructure breaches enable full system compromise

### Out-of-Scope (Not Included in This Audit)

**Excluded from audit:**
- **Mobile apps**: iOS/Android apps (future audit after mobile launch)
- **Third-party integrations**: Google OAuth, SendGrid (assume secure, validate signatures only)
- **Physical security**: Office access, hardware security (cloud-only deployment)
- **Social engineering**: Phishing, pretexting (focus on technical vulnerabilities)
- **Penetration testing**: Black-box external pentest (limited to known vulnerabilities, not red team)
- **Code review**: Full codebase review (focus on security-critical code only)

**Future audits:**
- Quarterly security reviews after launch
- SOC 2 Type II audit (when enterprise customers require it)
- Penetration testing by external firm (after 1 year in production)

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
**Applicable if:** Serving EU users (yes, in scope for this audit)

**Requirements to verify:**
- [ ] **Consent**: Cookie consent banner shown, users can opt out
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data (no unnecessary PII)
- [ ] **Right to Access**: Users can download their data (JSON export)
- [ ] **Right to Erasure**: Users can delete account and all data
- [ ] **Right to Portability**: Users can export data in machine-readable format
- [ ] **Data Breach Notification**: Process to notify users within 72 hours of breach
- [ ] **Privacy Policy**: Clear privacy policy explaining data usage (link in footer)

**Deliverables:**
- GDPR compliance checklist (completed)
- Data deletion endpoint tested (`DELETE /api/users/:id/gdpr`)
- Privacy policy reviewed by legal (if available)

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
**Applicable if:** Processing credit card payments (yes, Stripe integration)

**Requirements to verify:**
- [ ] **Cardholder Data**: Never store credit card numbers, CVV, or PINs
- [ ] **Stripe Elements**: Use Stripe Elements for card input (card data never touches our servers)
- [ ] **TLS Encryption**: All payment data transmitted over TLS 1.3
- [ ] **Access Controls**: Only authorized users can process refunds
- [ ] **Logging**: Payment transactions logged (amount, timestamp, user, status)
- [ ] **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans for vulnerabilities (quarterly)

**Note**: Since we use Stripe, we don't need full PCI DSS Level 1 compliance. Stripe is PCI DSS Level 1 certified, and we use their tokenization system (Stripe Elements) to avoid handling raw card data.

**Deliverables:**
- Stripe integration security checklist (completed)
- Webhook signature verification tested
- Payment flow tested with test cards

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
**Applicable if:** Enterprise customers require it (not required for MVP launch, future audit)

**Note**: SOC 2 Type II audit typically takes 6-12 months and costs $15k-50k. Not in scope for this pre-launch audit. Will address after first enterprise customer requests it.

## Testing Methodology

### Manual Security Testing

**Authentication Tests** (2 hours):
1. Register new account → verify email validation
2. Login with correct credentials → verify JWT issued
3. Login with wrong password 10 times → verify account lockout
4. Request password reset → verify token is single-use and expires
5. Login with expired JWT → verify 401 Unauthorized
6. Try to access another user's data → verify 403 Forbidden

**Authorization Tests** (2 hours):
1. Login as regular user → try admin endpoints → verify 403
2. Login as user A → try to access user B's projects → verify 403
3. Try to delete another user's task → verify 403
4. Try to modify project you're not a member of → verify 403

**Injection Tests** (2 hours):
1. SQL injection in login form: `' OR '1'='1`
2. XSS in task description: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
3. Command injection in filename: `; rm -rf /`
4. Path traversal in file download: `../../../etc/passwd`

**API Security Tests** (2 hours):
1. Test all endpoints without JWT → verify 401
2. Test rate limiting: send 150 requests in 1 minute → verify 429
3. Test CORS: send request from unauthorized origin → verify blocked
4. Test error handling: trigger 500 error → verify no stack trace exposed

**Payment Tests** (1 hour):
1. Test successful payment with test card: `4242424242424242`
2. Test failed payment with test card: `4000000000000002`
3. Test webhook with invalid signature → verify rejected
4. Test duplicate payment with same idempotency key → verify not charged twice

**Total manual testing time:** ~10 hours

### Automated Security Testing

**Tools to use:**
1. **npm audit** (dependency scanning):
   ```bash
   npm audit
   # Expected: 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
   ```

2. **OWASP ZAP** (web application scanner):
   ```bash
   zap-cli quick-scan --self-contained --start-options '-config api.disablekey=true' https://staging.taskmanager.com
   # Scan for XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.
   ```

3. **SQLMap** (SQL injection testing):
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "https://staging.taskmanager.com/api/auth/login" --data="email=test&password=test" --batch
   # Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
   ```

4. **Burp Suite** (manual penetration testing):
   - Proxy all traffic through Burp
   - Test for IDOR, privilege escalation, business logic flaws
   - Fuzzing API endpoints with malicious payloads

5. **git-secrets** (credential scanning):
   ```bash
   git secrets --scan
   # Scan git history for committed secrets
   ```

6. **Lighthouse** (frontend security):
   ```bash
   lighthouse https://staging.taskmanager.com --only-categories=best-practices
   # Check for mixed content, CSP, HTTPS, etc.
   ```

**Total automated testing time:** ~3 hours (plus 24 hours for OWASP ZAP full scan)

### Penetration Testing Scenarios

  3. Try to access `/api/users/123` (other user's profile)
  4. Try to export entire database via API
  5. Test for SQL injection to dump database
- **Expected outcome**: All attempts blocked, only own data accessible

**Scenario 3: Payment Fraud**
- **Goal**: Make purchases without paying
- **Steps**:
  1. Start checkout flow, capture API requests
  2. Try to modify payment amount to $0
  3. Try to reuse old payment confirmation token
  4. Try to bypass payment with fake webhook
- **Expected outcome**: All attempts blocked, payment always validated server-side
