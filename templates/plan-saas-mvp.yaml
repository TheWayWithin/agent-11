risk_templates:
  - risk: "Scope creep delays MVP launch"
    probability: high
    impact: high
    mitigation: "Strict MVP scope definition, defer nice-to-haves"
  - risk: "Technical debt accumulation"
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: "Document shortcuts taken, plan refactoring sprint"
  - risk: "Authentication/security vulnerabilities"
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: "Use established auth libraries, security review before launch"
  - risk: "Payment integration issues"
    probability: medium
    impact: high
    mitigation: "Test with sandbox/test mode extensively, webhook retry logic"

customization_hints:
  - "Extend Phase 2 duration for complex domain logic"
  - "Add Phase 0 for extensive research/discovery if problem space unclear"
  - "Reduce designer tasks if using established design system"
  - "Add analytics setup task if data-driven decisions critical"
  - "Consider splitting Phase 3 if payment integration is complex"
  - "Skip payment phase entirely for freemium MVP validation"

anti_patterns:
  - "Adding enterprise features (SSO, teams) before validation"
  - "Over-engineering infrastructure before product-market fit"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage at expense of shipping speed"
  - "Perfect UI polish before core value validation"
