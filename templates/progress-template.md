## Usage Guidelines

### When to Update This File

1. **After Each Deliverable**: Add to Deliverables section immediately
2. **After Each Change**: Log in Changes Made section with rationale
3. **When Issue Discovered**: Create issue entry with symptom and context
4. **After EACH Fix Attempt**: Log attempt with full detail (even if it fails)
5. **When Issue Resolved**: Add root cause analysis and prevention
6. **End of Day**: Update Daily Log with summary
7. **Pattern Recognition**: Add to Lessons Learned when insights emerge

### Critical Principles

**Document Failures**: Failed attempts are MORE valuable than successes for learning. Always log:
- What we tried
- Why we thought it would work
- What actually happened
- What we learned

**Root Cause Analysis**: Never stop at "it works now" - understand WHY the issue occurred and WHY the solution works.

**Prevention Focus**: Every resolved issue should include a strategy to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Temporal Distinction**:
- project-plan.md = FORWARD-LOOKING (what we're planning to do)
- progress.md = BACKWARD-LOOKING (what we did and learned)

## Template Notes

**Remove this section when using template**

- Replace all `[bracketed text]` with actual values
- Keep chronological order (newest entries at top of each section)
- Link between sections using issue IDs
- Be specific: file paths, line numbers, error messages, timestamps
- Focus on learning: why things failed is as important as how they succeeded
- Update frequently: don't wait for phase completion
- Cross-reference: link deliverables to changes to issues to lessons
