## üö® REAL-TIME UPDATE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: This file documents what has HAPPENED (backward-looking). Update IMMEDIATELY when events occur, not later.

### When to Update IMMEDIATELY (Not Later)

#### ‚úÖ UPDATE NOW (Real-Time)
1. **Deliverable Created/Modified** ‚Üí Log within 5 minutes of completion
   - Don't wait for phase end or daily summary
   - Capture while details are fresh
   - Include file paths and immediate impact

2. **Change Made to Code/Configs** ‚Üí Log immediately after change
   - Record rationale before context lost
   - Document "why" while decision is clear
   - Link to related issues if applicable

3. **Issue Discovered** ‚Üí Create issue entry the moment problem identified
   - Don't wait to understand full scope
   - Capture symptom and immediate context
   - Mark status as üî¥ Open

4. **Fix Attempted** ‚Üí Log EVERY attempt immediately after trying
   - Document even if fix fails (especially if it fails!)
   - Capture rationale before moving to next attempt
   - Record learning while insight is fresh

5. **Issue Resolved** ‚Üí Add root cause analysis within 30 minutes
   - Document why it worked before forgetting details
   - Capture prevention strategy while problem is clear
   - Link all attempted fixes for pattern recognition

#### ‚ùå DON'T WAIT (Common Anti-Patterns)

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Batch updates at end of day/week ("I'll log it later")
- ‚ùå Wait until issue fully resolved to start logging
- ‚ùå Skip logging failed attempts ("nobody needs to know what didn't work")
- ‚ùå Assume you'll remember details tomorrow
- ‚ùå Only log successes and hide failures
- ‚ùå Wait for phase completion to document lessons

**WHY REAL-TIME MATTERS**:
1. **Context Lost**: Details forgotten within hours, not days
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Failed attempts reveal patterns success hides
3. **Learning Value**: Failures teach more than successes
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history prevents repeated mistakes
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Next specialist needs full story, not sanitized version

### In-Progress Work Format

While actively working on tasks, use this format:

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Work Description] - üîµ IN PROGRESS
**Working on**: [Specific task or issue]
**Assigned to**: @[specialist]
**Started**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

**Current Status**:
[What's happening right now - update every 1-2 hours during active work]

**Progress So Far**:
- [Completed step 1]
- [Completed step 2]
- [Currently working on step 3]

**Blockers Encountered**:
- [Blocker 1 if any]
- [Temporary workaround if applicable]

**Next Steps**:
- [Immediate next action]

---
```

**Update this entry every 1-2 hours during active work** to maintain real-time status.

### Real-Time Update Examples

#### GOOD Example (Immediate Logging):
```markdown
### 2025-10-19 14:30 - Authentication Issue Discovered
**Discovered by**: @developer
**Status**: üî¥ Open

**Symptom**: Users logged out after 5 minutes unexpectedly

**Context**: Testing login flow, noticed session expires too quickly

#### Fix Attempts

##### Attempt #1: Increased token expiry - 2025-10-19 14:45
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed
**Rationale**: Thought 5-minute token expiry was too short
**What We Tried**: Changed JWT expiry from 5min to 60min
**Outcome**: Users still logged out after 5min - expiry time not the issue
**Learning**: Problem is NOT token expiry, must be refresh mechanism

##### Attempt #2: Fixed refresh token rotation - 2025-10-19 15:20
**Result**: ‚úÖ Success
**Rationale**: Refresh tokens not being stored/rotated properly
**What We Tried**: Added refresh token to localStorage with proper rotation
**Outcome**: Users now stay logged in correctly
**Learning**: Always check refresh mechanism before adjusting token expiry

#### Resolution
**Resolved**: 2025-10-19 15:30
**Root Cause**: Refresh token was not stored after login, causing session loss
**Prevention**: Add test to verify refresh token storage after authentication
```

#### BAD Example (Delayed Logging):
```markdown
### 2025-10-19 - Fixed authentication
**Fixed by**: @developer
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

Users were getting logged out. Fixed it by updating refresh tokens.
```
*(Problems: No timestamps, no failed attempts, no learning, no context, no root cause)*

### Daily Check-In Protocol

**End of Each Work Session** (15 minutes):
1. Review all in-progress entries - update current status
2. Convert completed work from "üîµ IN PROGRESS" to final entries
3. Ensure all attempted fixes logged (successes AND failures)
4. Check that all issues have current status (not stale)
5. Add any patterns or insights noticed during work

**DO NOT** wait for:
- Phase completion
- End of week
- Issue fully resolved
- All fixes attempted
- "Until I have something successful to report"

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Update This File

1. **After Each Deliverable**: Add to Deliverables section immediately
2. **After Each Change**: Log in Changes Made section with rationale
3. **When Issue Discovered**: Create issue entry with symptom and context
4. **After EACH Fix Attempt**: Log attempt with full detail (even if it fails)
5. **When Issue Resolved**: Add root cause analysis and prevention
6. **End of Day**: Update Daily Log with summary
7. **Pattern Recognition**: Add to Lessons Learned when insights emerge

### Critical Principles

**Document Failures**: Failed attempts are MORE valuable than successes for learning. Always log:
- What we tried
- Why we thought it would work
- What actually happened
- What we learned

**Root Cause Analysis**: Never stop at "it works now" - understand WHY the issue occurred and WHY the solution works.

**Prevention Focus**: Every resolved issue should include a strategy to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Temporal Distinction**:
- project-plan.md = FORWARD-LOOKING (what we're planning to do)
- progress.md = BACKWARD-LOOKING (what we did and learned)

## Template Notes

**Remove this section when using template**

- Replace all `[bracketed text]` with actual values
- Keep chronological order (newest entries at top of each section)
- Link between sections using issue IDs
- Be specific: file paths, line numbers, error messages, timestamps
- Focus on learning: why things failed is as important as how they succeeded
- Update frequently: don't wait for phase completion
- Cross-reference: link deliverables to changes to issues to lessons
