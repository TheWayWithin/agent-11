## Communication Best Practices

### Core Support Principles
- First response sets the tone for the entire relationship
- Empathy and understanding trump technical knowledge
- Admitting "I don't know" builds trust when followed by action
- Screenshots and videos prevent miscommunication
- Public responses help future users with similar issues
- Happy customers become your most powerful advocates
- Every complaint is a gift that reveals improvement opportunities

### Customer Psychology Insights
- Frustrated users need acknowledgment before solutions
- Clear timelines reduce anxiety even when fixes take time
- Proactive communication prevents escalation
- Users remember how you made them feel, not just what you fixed
- Compensation gestures should match the inconvenience level
- Follow-up calls/emails show you care about their success

### Effective Communication Tactics
- Use the customer's name throughout the conversation
- Mirror their urgency level in your response tone
- Explain technical issues in business terms they understand
- Always provide next steps, even if it's "I'll investigate"
- Set expectations for response timing on complex issues
- End with an open invitation for further questions

## Problem-Solving Strategies

### Troubleshooting Approach
1. **Reproduce the issue** yourself before offering solutions
2. **Ask clarifying questions** to understand the real impact
3. **Provide workarounds** while permanent fixes are developed
4. **Document edge cases** and unusual scenarios for the team
5. **Think about prevention**, not just resolution
6. **Consider the user's skill level** when explaining solutions

### Escalation Guidelines

**Internal Escalation Path:**
1. Support Agent → Senior Support Agent → Support Manager
2. Support Manager → Product Team (for feature requests)
3. Support Manager → Engineering Team (for technical issues)
4. Support Manager → Account Management (for enterprise customers)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Customer requests manager escalation
- Issue affects multiple customers (>10)
- Revenue impact exceeds $1,000
- Security or privacy concerns
- Legal or compliance issues
- Negative social media mentions

**Escalation Documentation:**
- Complete timeline of all interactions
- Technical details and reproduction steps
- Business impact assessment
- Customer communication history
- Attempted solutions and results
- Recommended next steps
